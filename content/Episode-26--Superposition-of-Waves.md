- Introduction<span id='TrtVXM2Od'/>
- T - In this episode we’ll be having a look at the concept of wave ‘superposition’, which is just what happens when you put waves on top of each other.<span id='u5gq_etWE'/>
- H - We’ll then be looking in detail about the idea of stationary waves, we’ve touched on these a little in previous episodes. They are was where energy is not moving from one place to another, but there is still a lot of oscillating going on.<span id='kD0-dHtM6'/>
- T - Then we’ll have a look at something called diffraction, which is basically when waves ‘bend’ around corners, objects and holes.<span id='Haqnxvtdv'/>
- H - Right let's get started then and talk first of all about being in a great location.<span id='8QFoNqqsY'/>
- T - You mean superposition. Lame physicists joke. Apologies to all.<span id='frNqCoDdp'/>
- H - We physicists are renowned for our sense of humour. And our sarcasm.<span id='JrOZnRD_L'/>
- T- Moving on…<span id='JkZt1BN5Q'/>
- The superposition principle is an extremely important idea that has applications in almost all branches of not only [[Physics]], but also Maths too.<span id='pCZ0Y7_Ug'/>
- H - Hmmm ‘superposition’. It’s a new word to most people. When introducing new words I always like to start with a word you might have heard already that sounds a bit like the new word.<span id='Fx7oY_smt'/>
- T - How about superimpose?<span id='6Iish2bKU'/>
- H - Yes, it’s possible that you’ve heard the word superimpose before. The dictionary definition of superimpose is this:<span id='UUXlK_N-5'/>
- Superimpose: Vb - To place or lay (one thing) over another, typically so that both are still evident.<span id='Wav-MzYPi'/>
- E.g. "the number will appear on the screen, **superimposed on** a flashing button”<span id='a9F9zEWZn'/>
- This means that you can still see both the flashing button and the number on top of it. It’s a fancy way of saying ‘on top of’ really.<span id='-Lv287QAX'/>
- T - Yes, but crucially the idea is that both things are in the same place, yet you can still see the effects of both of them.<span id='QniZ258Z6'/>
- H- Yep, In [[Physics]] terms it’s this:<span id='zd44uo17I'/>
- The idea is that the response of a system to two different stimuli simultaneously being applied is the same as the sum of the responses to the individual stimuli, separately applied.<span id='nQzots12f'/>
- T- __Oh it’s that simple is it? (Sarcasm)__<span id='v9YgkCGRs'/>
- H- Yeah to be honest that’s a complicated way of saying it. It’s actually really simple.<span id='l3T-xz8_f'/>
- T - Let’s say you have two things which create an effect. If you do both things, you still get both effects independently happening. And the total effect you get just by adding the effects of each thing.<span id='QKYztx_w_'/>
- H - Say you have an elastic band and you stretch it by 1cm. You measure the restoring **force** that the band exerts on your hand to be 10 N. Let’s now say that you stretch the band by 2 cm and measure the **force** to be 20N. The superposition principle now says that if you stretch the band to 3 cm (which is 2 cm plus 1 cm) we should measure the restoring **force** to be 30N (which is 10N plus 20N). This is in accordance with what we’d expect from Hooke’s law too.<span id='yniN-L2VV'/>
- T- So because we knew the responses to the separate extensions, we could figure out the response to the total extension by adding the results from before? This new rule makes [[Physics]] really easy…<span id='B7Dujh5-g'/>
- H- Unfortunately, the superposition principle only works when the equations governing the system are linear. Without worrying too much about what this means specifically, we can see that this logic wouldn’t work for power losses in a resistor which are given by P equals i squared R.<span id='MCBJ9PjrM'/>
- T- Ah yes the fact that the current term is squared means that you can’t just add the power losses from a 3 amp flow to a 2 amp flow and expect to get the correct result for a 5 amp flow. This rule actually doesn’t even work for elastic bands once we reach extreme extensions.<span id='XC4QbEIiW'/>
- H - Exactly. Elastic bands are actually quite non-linear. You KNOW this already, because you stretch an elastic band and it seems to be going all nicely for a bit, and then it gets near to the limit of its stretchiness and it takes a huge amount of **force** to stretch it even a little bit.<span id='l3MqGFFg9'/>
- T - And then it snaps.<span id='0DJhFdubT'/>
- H - Precisely.<span id='VZxraX4r7'/>
- H- Don’t get us wrong though, it’s really useful in a lot of places even if only over small ranges. Most importantly for you, it works for when you’ve got more than one wave in the same place.<span id='-osCfvt9T'/>
- T- Right so how can we use this to understand what happens when two waves pass through each other?<span id='O7vfd3AE-'/>
- H- It’s very simple, we can add the **Displacement**s of both waves at every point in space to get the resulting wave. We need to be careful to take into consideration the sign of the **Displacement**s too.<span id='UTw2S9YAA'/>
- T- Okay so that’s interesting and all but when is this actually useful?<span id='WggKA1eiC'/>
- H- Ah the question all Physicists love to hear… So there is this one particularly insightful example. When we have two identical waves heading towards each other. When this happens we create something called a standing wave.<span id='WY-0Pr0jB'/>
- T- It’s called a standing wave because unlike a regular wave, it’s not seen to move. Another way of putting this is that energy is not transferred along space by a standing wave. This makes sense when we remember how the wave was formed, by two identical waves moving into each other from opposite directions. They both carry the same energy so the net flow of energy should be zero. Makes sense right?<span id='2ouw_R2vf'/>
- H- Standing waves have two main features. Nodes and antinodes. Nodes are points along the wave that do not go up and down (or side to side). From now on we will use the word ‘oscillate’ which means either to go up and down, backwards and forwards, or side to side.<span id='8FiAztljP'/>
- T - So where the two component waves cancel out at all times you get no visible oscillation at all. We call this a Node. (Think ‘No’ sounds like ‘Node’ to help you remember there’s NO oscillation here.)<span id='T-bTrpOuK'/>
- T- Antinodes are the points along the wave that oscillate with the greatest amplitude, which is the sum of the amplitudes of the two component waves. The Antinode is just the opposite of the node.<span id='mAsYyBYWG'/>
- H- Standing waves are “cool” because we can see many examples of them in everyday life.<span id='aa13J2LYq'/>
- T- I personally think the most important application of them is to measure the speed of light using cheese on toast.<span id='JH7esYnBw'/>
- H- Oh yeah? So how does that work?<span id='962Y7CRbk'/>
- T-  Microwaves set up standing waves inside them to cook their food. That’s why they have rotating plates, to make sure all parts of the food pass through the antinodes and get cooked. If they didn’t have the rotating plate, some parts of the food would be located at an antinode and the water molecules at this point would be oscillated a lot by these antinodes. (Microwaves work by producing electromagnetic wave energy at frequencies that are preferentially absorbed by water molecules.)<span id='jEs9UCxE-'/>
- H - However, other parts of the food would be at nodes, and any water molecules at these points would not get bounced around at all by the microwaves, and so these parts would remain cold. So, the rotating plate makes sure that all parts of the food pass through a balance of antinodes and nodes during the heating session.<span id='yyGsi8uSm'/>
- T - OK, so if you take out this spinning plate and then sprinkle a bit of cheese on some toast before popping it in the microwave. A standing wave will pass through the toast so parts of the cheese will melt whilst other parts won’t. The distance between the centres of the melted parts of cheese is half the wavelength of the microwave radiation. If you look on the side of your microwave you should be able to get the frequency of the radiation and from that you can get a really, really rough but tasty result for the speed of light. Izzzittt.<span id='qIb2mKl29'/>
- H - So, why is that distance equal to half the wavelength and not the whole wavelength? That’s a great point, but if you look at a standing wave, for every one complete wavelength, you’ve got two ends that are nodes, where nothing much is happening, and another point in the middle where you get another node. But in the middle of each of these nodes you have 2 antinodes. You can think of a wave as having an ‘UP’ bit and a ‘DOWN’ bit.<span id='Du19GtniZ'/>
- T - Yep, technically the up bit goes up and down, and the down bit goes down and up, but the point is that each wave cycle has 2 antinodes. So, the distance between these antinodes is equal to half a wavelength.<span id='u21YSmjMF'/>
- H- Right so now that we’ve talked about superposition and standing waves, it’s time to talk about some of the more general properties of waves.<span id='ZISUJ3gD7'/>
- T- Travelling waves behave in a completely different way to how we might expect solid particles to.<span id='7hsQUP-ib'/>
- H - Particles in general appear to move in straight lines. (It’s a lot more complicated than that, thanks to general relativity, but we’ll leave that for now…)<span id='nwkdZS1CP'/>
- T - Yep, so, even though we think that light etc. travels in straight lines. It really doesn’t exactly. It kind of bends around corners. A bit.<span id='Xlf3zEBva'/>
- H - Actually all waves do. This is how you can hear sounds from around a corner. But, light doesn’t SEEM to go around a corner because the size of the light wave is very different to the size of the sound wave. And that’s the cause of this apparent difference.<span id='BbSmXw2qg'/>
- T - In general, if we emit a wave onto a gap with a size SIMILAR to the wavelength of the wave we observe diffraction, which is basically the bending of the wave round the obstacle.<span id='r6YuNjIfM'/>
- H - This word diffraction means bending. It comes from the Latin __diffringere __which means to break into pieces. And it was used to describe how the light appeared to break into pieces when it went around a corner, through a very small slit, or hole or around an object.<span id='g3OoGNGfr'/>
- H- One of the most surprising things that we’ve learnt from quantum mechanics is that any ‘particle’, on a small enough length scale, behaves like a wave by diffracting too. This is the famous wave-particle duality you’ve probably heard Brian Cox bang on about.<span id='eUblbZYKS'/>
- T - And the wave-particle duality thing is really interesting. All moving things have a wavelength and all waves get diffracted when they go around an object, or through a gap. But the key thing is that the diffraction is only meaningful when the wave goes through a gap or around an object of about the same size as the wavelength of the wave.<span id='25mobV-b1'/>
- T- You see water waves diffracting when they go through a break in a harbour, because the gap is often around the same size as the wavelength of the water wave.<span id='IVxnYqIn2'/>
- H - Light waves diffract when you close your eyes almost but not quite shut. Do it now as you listen to this podcast. Look at a lamp or a bright light and close your eyelid until you can barely see the light. As your eyelids close, the light will start to spread out into what looks like a beam. This is diffraction happening as the gap bewteen your eyelids gest small enough to be similar to the wavelength of the light waves.<span id='UXy33XYuF'/>
- T - Great, well that’s enough for now. Let’s leave it there and pick up next episode with some more on interference of waves and using a diffraction grating.<span id='wN0AJGH36'/>
- H - Can’t wait!<span id='LF-rNcFHj'/>
- T - Bye for now<span id='mkNTcfMIA'/>
