- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='uBMn53GbQ'/>
- H - Welcome back everybody, we’re cracking on with some more stuff on waves.<span id='76saM2jtA'/>
- T - Yep, in this episode we’ll introduce the concept of the Electromagnetic Spectrum and we’ll explain how scientists worked out that the universe was expanding using a neat bit of [[Physics]] called the Doppler Effect.<span id='rz839qA2U'/>
- H - Yep, let’s start right there with the Doppler Effect. It’s something you’ve all observed whether or not you knew its name.<span id='YCibX1NZi'/>
- T - Yep anytime you happened to be around a speeding police car or ambulance with the siren on and you would have observed this effect for sure.<span id='H6r3e8WaZ'/>
- H - Even when any kind of car moved past you as a pedestrian you’d have observed the Doppler effect. It’s everywhere.<span id='oDMFXT0dd'/>
- T - So, what is it exactly?<span id='L5zZBoXqO'/>
- H - Well in simple terms it’s the difference you notice in the sound of a siren between when a police car is coming towards you and then going away from you.<span id='W6tpJjP5-'/>
- T - Yep, we all notice that. As the car comes close the sound becomes higher pitched, and as it moves away from you it becomes lower pitched. (The pitch of a sound wave is how ‘high’ or ‘low’ the note is.)<span id='t2gNjbCOW'/>
- H - In formal [[Physics]] language, the pitch is the frequency of vibration of the wave. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch, the higher the sound of the note.<span id='IVfq7RAwS'/>
- T - For musicians, you might know that the pitch of a note goes up an octave when the frequency of the wave doubles.<span id='p2KfoxhNf'/>
- H - yep, interestingly the note used for keeping an orchestra in tune is A4, which is the A above middle C. And this is set to a frequency of 440 Hz, which means 440 wave cycles per second.<span id='PcI5MMSRY'/>
- T - And the A one octave below is 220 Hz and the A one octave above is 880 Hz. The frequency of all waves is measured in hertz.<span id='hB0tLmUvC'/>
- H - Ok, well it turns out that there is a reason the pitch of a note appears to go up when coming from something that is moving towards you and we'll go into the [[Physics]] of it now.<span id='S8zQXsBV7'/>
- T - OK, great.<span id='7dvKQSK8Z'/>
- H - First of all, pitch is just the word we give to how ‘high or low’ a note sounds to our ears. And really it is a measure of the rate at which our ear drums are vibrating.<span id='Ndvv5N-1A'/>
- T - Yep, and what makes the eardrums vibrate is the air that is moving backwards and forwards as a result of the vibration of the thing that is making the sound in the first place.<span id='grrl901f9'/>
- H - Precisely. The guitar string, or drum skin, or police siren, vibrates up and down, forwards and backwards or side to side. It ‘oscillates’. And as it does so it pushes the air that it is touching. This ‘push’ creates a pulse of pressure which moves away from the string or drum in all directions. And you get lots of pulses per second when you have a high frequency.<span id='1orsA_F6H'/>
- T - And this pulse of moving air pushes anything it touches with exactly the same frequency as it vibrates itself.<span id='SgS274mmG'/>
- H - Yes. Almost.<span id='dVBR7It02'/>
- T - How do you mean? Well, if it is stationary then this is true, but if the guitar, or drum or police siren is moving then something interesting happens.<span id='jDPCZjj21'/>
- H - The vibrations are all happening at the same frequency, say 50 times per second, or 50 hertz.<span id='Xvt86VcUZ'/>
- T - And that means that any air in contact is also vibrating at 50 hertz and so would your ears be.<span id='PdFSyzBJe'/>
- H - Except if the whole thing is moving towards you. Imagine your ears are responding to the vibrating siren. The siren pushes towards you and away from you 50 times every second, right?<span id='Q09K5DY6L'/>
- T - Yep<span id='EH3LdPS1u'/>
- H - But as the car is now moving towards you, the whole siren is now moving towards you at the speed of a police car, say 40 metres per second?<span id='oR8MOdNjF'/>
- T - Yep, got it.<span id='dmdTomg3m'/>
- H - So this means each new wave that is being produced by the siren doesn't have as far to travel as the previous one and so reaches your ear sooner than you might expect if the car wasn't moving.<span id='9y5f_vaUv'/>
- T - That means that your ear is then pushed increasingly sooner than you expect and that means more times per second or a greater frequency.<span id='NIriEH8dr'/>
- H - Which means that the pitch of the note goes up.<span id='Gja3LjUPj'/>
- T - Ok, because the waves are arriving closer together than when they left.<span id='tOZyv-Zhg'/>
- H - Yes. Remember that the rate at which your ears are being pushed is interpreted by your brain as the pitch of the note. So, as a police siren comes towards you its pitch increases. The waves are still produced at the same frequency, so if you were inside the police car, the pitch of the siren would always sound the same.<span id='W6oFegi2H'/>
- T - But if you are observing the siren, as the car comes towards you, the waves arrive faster and faster (more waves per second) which gives a rising pitch.<span id='oWYgDYivJ'/>
- H - So, what might happen when the police car is now moving away from you?<span id='S5KpuFSQy'/>
- T - Well, we can leave that to your imagination, [[Physics]] intuition and the logic of symmetry.<span id='PJQuh5nHI'/>
- H - er, What???<span id='5WSpM3qh8'/>
- T - Well, it just seems obvious that the opposite would happen. If the pitch of a note goes up when a police siren is moving towards you then it makes sense that the pitch will go down when the siren is moving away from you.<span id='nilP0gAqa'/>
- H - and the [[Physics]] of the situation is equally simple: when something moves away from you, even though the waves are being produced at the same rate, each wave is being released from slightly further away than the previous one, and so the waves arrive at your ears less often than you might expect. And so your ears get pushed less often as the siren moves away from you.<span id='Yxk8usKI6'/>
- T - Less often is just lower frequency and so the pitch of the note goes down.<span id='1lYFr_mPL'/>
- H - And here's the formula for it:<span id='8Oh-5DLB7'/>
- The apparent frequency is greater than the true frequency by a factor which depends on the **Velocity** of sound and the relative **Velocity** between the source and the observer.<span id='uXKywV-Es'/>
- For simplicity we assume that you, the observer, is stationary and the siren is moving at **Velocity** s, and the **Velocity** of the sound waves in air is given by v<span id='I_RG7WpD_'/>
- The adjustment factor for the frequency is just v divided by v minus s when the siren is coming towards you and v divided by v plus s when it is moving away<span id='sGFkhd195'/>
- T - So you just take the ‘true’ frequency, let's call it f and multiply it by v over v minus s when it's moving towards you and multiply it by v over v plus s when it's moving away from you.<span id='2FvsjIcFy'/>
- H - That's basically it. And as a quick reminder - towards you gives a higher pitch, and so the factor has a smaller number on the bottom, (since dividing by a smaller number increases the value) and so it's v minus s when it's coming towards you at a **Velocity** of s metres per second<span id='_Mi2rWF3n'/>
- T - Ok Doppler shift. Got it. It helps us understand how police sirens change pitch when they go by. Great. So, what is it actually GOOD for?<span id='mF47mK45v'/>
- H - I'm very glad you asked that. Well, it turns out that if we can record the frequency that you observe and you know the true frequency, you can work out the relative **Velocity** between you and the thing you're measuring. And if we assume that you are stationary, then you can calculate the actual speed of the thing that's moving: police car, guitar, bongo drum, whatever.<span id='tSLIN0JOO'/>
- T - That's pretty neat and we use it all the time when we want to know how fast something is going and we can't easily measure the distance it's traveling in a certain time.<span id='s9ENxmQog'/>
- H - Police speed guns for example use the Doppler effect for measuring how fast a speeding car is going. Technically they use electromagnetic waves rather than sound waves but the idea is the same. They shoot waves at a speeding car and then record the frequency of the waves that bounce back off the car.<span id='NNbkGxOmy'/>
- T - Yep, it's pretty neat. The frequency shift you record of the reflected waves gives you the relative speed of the object the waves bounce off.<span id='GMGia0yRv'/>
- H - and it's even used in sports to calculate the speed of a cricket ball bowling or a tennis serve etc. It's really handy.<span id='vVOdtVgSa'/>
- T - Not Just for law en**force**ment. Bargain.<span id='IoarPNx9W'/>
- H - Yep, and there's an even more exciting implementation of the Doppler Effect - working out the expansion rate of the universe.<span id='7uxU1ndx7'/>
- T - And that neatly brings us on to electromagnetic waves and the electromagnetic spectrum<span id='QxlWK-Urp'/>
- H - So, first of all, let's just say a brief word on electromagnetic waves by way of example.<span id='Ior1y4T_v'/>
- T - It turns out that light, microwaves, radio waves and X-rays are exactly the same type of wave, just differently ‘bunched up’<span id='qydmfmzA9'/>
- H - And by ‘bunched up’ we mean how close together the waves are, i.e. how big they are.<span id='W4ssR41WO'/>
- T - So, you take a radio wave and squeeze it together and it acts like a microwave, squeeze the waves closer and it becomes an infra-red wave, then a visible light wave, closer still it acts like an ultra-violet wave, then an X-Ray and then finally a gamma ray.<span id='eNW8D4lJ_'/>
- H - rays and waves are interchangeable words we use to describe the same thing.<span id='89f5uLdc2'/>
- T - Technically the electromagnetic waves are all photons with different energy, and the higher the energy, the more bunched up the waves are, i.e. The higher the frequency.<span id='sH6GHBJjo'/>
- H - Correspondingly, the more bunched up the waves are, the shorter they must be, so they have a shorter distance between each wave, or wave ‘length’.<span id='MXkYo4ybS'/>
- T - And this explains how the frequency and wavelength of waves are related. When one goes up, the other goes down. This mathematical relationship is called an inverse relationship.<span id='k_qpN3wC-'/>
- H - Another way of explaining an inverse relationship is to say that when you multiply the two values together they always give you the same answer.<span id='0xKnJGKpx'/>
- T - So, the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave multiplied by its frequency is always the same number, a constant.<span id='K1k9uy-_l'/>
- H - And this constant for each type of wave has a name. It's called the **Velocity** of the wave.<span id='GlvkiRjUw'/>
- T - Yes, it's the wave equation again: **Velocity** equals frequency times wavelength, or v = f lambda for short<span id='dK7t1nzM2'/>
- H - so the frequency of a radio wave times its wavelength equals the speed of the radio wave<span id='Za3bhUBR4'/>
- T - Similarly, the frequency of a gamma ray times the wavelength of the gamma ray equals its speed.<span id='Qaw7YwSmF'/>
- H - And this speed is the same for all electromagnetic waves and we refer to it colloquially as the speed of light<span id='ijzMeLjcA'/>
- T - All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light (in a vacuum - as they don't all travel through gases, liquids and solids at the same speed)<span id='44c-2PKng'/>
- T - From now on we just tend to use c as the speed of light whenever we are talking about the speed of any electromagnetic wave.<span id='XkJNjm-VJ'/>
- H - And that's interesting to know that these very differently behaving waves are all essentially the same wave, just at different frequencies.<span id='OQQjRsLW9'/>
- T - So, let's just have a quick think about what this means and relate it to energy.<span id='aaMYQl8se'/>
- H - Let's take an electron for a second. An electron is a charged particle and as such it interacts with other charged particles.<span id='i-ht-2dWZ'/>
- T - Remeber when we talked about **force**s? And we explained that it was much more helpful to talk about interactions and mediators rather than **force**s themselves?<span id='OpHeoJF1g'/>
- H - Yes, well it turns out that this interaction between charged particles, is carried out by electromagnetic waves.<span id='HGF3Lmoga'/>
- T - From now on we will refer to all electromagnetic waves as photons for simplicity.<span id='gzP6ms0qa'/>
- H - So the photon is the mediator of the interaction between charged particles: When charges move about they emit photons.<span id='jDo478rEQ'/>
- T - These photons get absorbed by other charged particles and you have an effect.<span id='s3t9vDDcT'/>
- H - So, when an electron moves about it emits photons and the amount of energy it moves with determines the energy of the emitted photons.<span id='D3Ze9fpIX'/>
- T - Ok. That makes sense.<span id='qm_kz8lpv'/>
- H - Yep, so consider an electron in a wire. You could get it to move about and see what photons it emits.<span id='OmWL1isc8'/>
- T - It turns out that the more energy you put into moving the electrons, the more energy the photons have when they fly off and this relates to a higher frequency of the emitted photon<span id='125VqVVDw'/>
- H - So basically what we are saying is that if you put a bunch of energy into moving an electron, it will emit high energy photons - i.e. X rays of gamma rays<span id='BhTmUucIQ'/>
- T - And if you put less energy into accelerating the electrons you'll get a lower energy photon, like a radio wave or a microwave.<span id='z1Mn_eYGZ'/>
- H - We're not going to get too far into the reason these waves are called electromagnetic and not just electric waves, but it's basically because whenever you create a changing electric field, you also create a changing magnetic field and these kind of loop around influencing each other continuously.<span id='JaewZwa-Z'/>
- T - we don't really understand why this happens but we know that it does, and we know that photon behaviour is best explained by a photon having both an associated  electric and magnetic field. Hence, electromagnetic waves.<span id='lUjox8bAs'/>
- H - Anyway, we now have a basic understanding that there are a huge range of different electromagnetic waves, each with different frequency but all travelling at the same speed.<span id='7KBRCIiYI'/>
- T - And we can combine this knowledge with the Doppler Effect to work out something really neat: how fast things are moving away from Earth.<span id='xl0s96LXo'/>
- H - in particular, if we measure the light coming from stars we notice that the frequencies we observe are different from what we might expect if the star wasn't moving.<span id='jcwTHfEJE'/>
- T - This makes sense of course, since we couldn't reasonably expect that the stars would be still relative to Earth.<span id='RjMArnRvB'/>
- H - However, what's really weird is that whichever star we looked at, the Doppler shift was always towards the lower frequencies. In other words - the light always seemed at a lower pitch than if there was no relative **Velocity**.<span id='nJXGfcrls'/>
- T - And a lower pitch means it's moving away right?<span id='SFfr-dnZn'/>
- H - Precisely. Whatever star we look at, the Doppler shift was to the low frequency end (this is towards the red end of the visible spectrum) and so we call this shift a red shift.<span id='rdhJOLpcV'/>
- T - All the frequencies of light we observed were shifted towards the red end. Whatever star we looked at?<span id='zUYIYChCZ'/>
- H - Yes, in every direction.<span id='5NCXKAOO3'/>
- T - Which can only mean one thing. If everything is moving away from us, in every direction, the whole universe must be expanding!!!!<span id='jpBemcOzj'/>
- H - This was a breakthrough finding for physicists. It was the biggest piece of evidence pointing towards an expanding universe theory.<span id='xCmXE2ouT'/>
- T - and it also turned out that the further away the galaxies were, the more the light was red shifted.<span id='bX0iRE21A'/>
- H - Which could only mean that the universe was expanding at an accelerated rate. In other words, the rate of expansion of the universe was increasing.<span id='j1rUPk2BF'/>
- T - excellent, well that's probably enough for today. In summary, the amount of shift in frequency of observed waves can do everything from tell us the speed of a cricket ball to the expansion rate of the universe.<span id='Ux7P9WBpC'/>
- H - Indeed. Pretty useful stuff all round!<span id='LDIGG-EKu'/>
- T - That's all from us. Hope you have a better understanding of waves now and we'll see you in the next one.<span id='dhwc0CyYi'/>
- H - Bye for now!<span id='ZNHnuCbnb'/>
