- So let’s get cracking…<span id='X4TIcqriR'/>
- **What’s the big idea?**<span id='N4bj7hPNA'/>
- Generally speaking, dynamics is all about how a physical system might develop or alter over time and the study of the causes of those changes.<span id='XnBB9tt39'/>
- **Why is it important?**<span id='LWxMEb4u1'/>
- It’s important because most objects in the universe are undergoing a change in their state of motion most of the time, and an understanding of how these changes come about and how we might be able to influence these changes for our benefit is really quite useful.<span id='gwV8NQej-'/>
- It’s dynamics that got us to the moon.<span id='BuvTV18Kn'/>
- **So, what’s our starting point?**<span id='8jOWU04Qa'/>
- The starting point is that we need to state clearly what we mean by state of motion and we need to introduce the idea of relativity. Not Einstein’s more exotic relativity perhaps, but the simple idea about the difference between absolute motion and relative motion.<span id='JSuwsJb9Y'/>
- In [[Physics]] and the Jedi code, there are no absolutes. Everything is relative to something else and it is meaningless to think in [[Physics]] of the idea of an absolute form of motion. This has tripped up a lot of physicists over the years, so you don’t have to worry if it seems tricky to comprehend.<span id='9fa4vkAcm'/>
- H - Let me explain.<span id='x6ZzVOCn8'/>
- What is your state of motion as you listen to this podcast? A simple way of answering this question would be to estimate how fast you were going.<span id='g6RDytNjK'/>
- What’s the first thing you would want to clarify?<span id='dRsOE52Yz'/>
- It’s probably going to be something like ‘relative to what?’<span id='XHYQt_6SA'/>
- H - Let’s imagine you are sitting at a desk. You might not be moving at all, relative to the earth. But you are most certainly in motion. The earth itself is spinning on its axis at something like 300 metres per second, and orbiting the sun at something like 30,000 metres per second. The solar system itself is rotating around the centre of the Milky Way galaxy at around 300,000 metres per second and the whole galaxy is moving relative to other galaxies at upwards of 500,000 metres per second.<span id='DahxPLi7q'/>
- It’s complicated.<span id='BFU36HNNO'/>
- But we can do our best to simplify it by making a few assumptions.<span id='EfxWRpbeJ'/>
- T - Newton came up with a few assumptions that seem to work pretty well and these came to be known as Newton’s laws of motion. The first thing Newton did was to talk about something which he defined as a ‘**force**’. **force**s are in many ways quite a confusing concept, and advanced physicists prefer to talk of interactions rather than **force**s, but they are nonetheless quite a helpful way of making sense of our observations. In particular, they can be used to generate testable predictions and they can be most helpfully thought of as invisible pushes, pulls and turns.<span id='R9neJpzAH'/>
- H - Newton defined the term ‘**force**’ in terms of three principles:<span id='bb_Tfztgd'/>
- You should have encountered these before as Newton’s laws, and here they are in summary:<span id='u-U1eQ2K_'/>
- T - Newton’s first law is all about maintaining the status quo and in essence it says that things will carry on as they are, unless something is acting upon them. We call this a **force**.<span id='6i6oQcVO5'/>
- H - In [[Physics]] language we say:<span id='o8YQMz93A'/>
- A body will continue in its state of motion (either at rest or moving with constant **Velocity**) unless acted upon by a **force**.<span id='RGhPOgJH3'/>
- T - So, a change in state of motion needs a **force** to make it happen.<span id='CCUu7ngLD'/>
- H - Newton’s second law is all about the change in motion that the **force** causes. This law is actually quite intuitive as it says that the change in motion that a **force** causes depends on how big the **force** is, and how ‘lined up’ the **force** is with the existing motion.<span id='-HRFP7cdo'/>
- T - In technical language we say:<span id='Ujne65_gF'/>
- The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the **force** applied to a body and takes place in the direction of the **force**.<span id='PfHDmMoZ5'/>
- H - Don't panic here if you don't yet know the concept of momentum. Momentum is a much easier concept to imagine than a **force**. Because we can actually feel momentum. Every time we catch a ball we experience it and the momentum of a ball is basically how hard the ball is to stop. In [[Physics]] terms it is the product of the mass of the ball and the **Velocity** of the ball.<span id='EByyLnsiy'/>
- T - Yes, so a fast moving ball is harder to stop than a slow moving ball. Similarly, a train moving at 10 meters per second would be a lot harder to stop than a fly moving at 10 meters per second.<span id='UzBwgFQRv'/>
- H - And so you can think of Newton’s second law as meaning that you need a big **force** to change the state of motion of something that's got a lot of momentum.<span id='O1YzqeOZR'/>
- T - Or, the bigger a **force** you apply to a body, and the more you change its state of motion.<span id='W82cGCm9O'/>
- H - In contrast, Newton’s third law is almost totally counterintuitive. It states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<span id='9WT0WxziI'/>
- T - Yeah. Exactly. What on earth does that actually mean?<span id='A277JSMCN'/>
- H - This makes very little sense when you analyse it deeply but it works pretty well for calculations and basically says that **force**s always occur in equal and opposite pairs. It’s really a conservation statement relating to how difficult something is to shift.<span id='BbSeDEklb'/>
- T - OK, so let’s say you are standing on a stationary skateboard pointing towards me.<span id='pOS1Xpi2T'/>
- H - OK, go on.<span id='k-Mc2uOdc'/>
- T - What would happen to the skateboard if you jumped off the skateboard towards me?<span id='tBKSmA3Kp'/>
- H - The skateboard would shoot off in the opposite direction.<span id='SlBpmzcgE'/>
- T - Exactly, and how fast it shot off would depend on a few factors in regular non-[[Physics]] language; how big you are, the size of the jump that you make, the size of the skateboard, the friction between the wheels of the skateboard and the surface it is resting on etc.<span id='QCm0NVJkM'/>
- H - Yeah, absolutely. That makes sense.<span id='eqVUlJQHm'/>
- And it’s more of a result of observation rather than something that we can work out from first principles.<span id='VMCq2kzkR'/>
- We observe someone jumping off a skateboard and note that the person and the skateboard seem to change their momentum oppositely and equally.<span id='zCD1JzoDk'/>
- T - So, since we define that it is a **force** that is responsible for the rate of change of momentum of an object, we conclude that the **force**s involved must also be equal and opposite.<span id='smZj3HuYG'/>
- H - Accordingly, we conclude that the person exerts a **force** on the skateboard and the skateboard exerts an equal and opposite **force** on the person.<span id='17BubB1jV'/>
- T - So, if the **force**s are equal and opposite, how does anything move?<span id='sUV7cOdV-'/>
- H - The trick to remember here is that the **force**s may be equal and opposite, but they act on **different** bodies.<span id='poDjlXugH'/>
- T - And since the mass of each body is different, the same **force** can produce different motions for each of the bodies.<span id='jfWSxCgXt'/>
- Imagine someone swimming in a big pool of water.<span id='1Rk4jp9t5'/>
- The swimmer pushes on the water and the water pushes back equally on the swimmer. The swimmer moves relative to the water because the swimmer’s mass is much lower than the mass of the water in the pool.<span id='K_d1EW6Sv'/>
- H - Not the easiest one to get, this third law, but the key is to remember that **force**s act in equal and opposite pairs but always on different bodies.<span id='KMwOKxvet'/>
- And in the next episode we will get into this with a few examples.<span id='f0wYsZRLQ'/>
