title: "backward chaining"

- Backward chaining and backwards chaining are very slightly different, wlthough both are examples of what I refer to as [[Reverse Learning]]<span id='dNM4WMaCO'/>
- in the domain of behavioural psychology it’s called 'backwards chaining'<span id='V-_z5WvHQ'/>
- in the domain of artificial intelligence it’s called backward chaining and is pretty much the same process as reverse learning:<span id='J9z1_1gRd'/>

    - [Chaining](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaining) is a technique used in [applied behavior analysis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_behavior_analysis) to teach complex tasks by breaking them down into discrete responses or individual behaviors that are part of a task analysis.<span id='K6DkLUSfO'/>

    - **Backward chaining** (or **backward reasoning**) is an [inference](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference) method described colloquially as working backward from the goal. It is used in [automated theorem provers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_prover), [inference engines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference_engine), [proof assistants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant), and other [artificial intelligence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) applications.<span id='HDSL70ZkU'/>
