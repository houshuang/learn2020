    - **accuracy**<span id='oEcZbG6L5'/>
        - A measurement result is considered accurate if it is judged to be close to the true value.<span id='_f1Wb44ob'/>
    - Calibration<span id='O0jmwg_Bp'/>
        - Marking a scale on a measuring instrument. This involves establishing the relationship between indications of a measuring instrument and standard or reference quantity values, which must be applied. For example, placing a thermometer in melting ice to see whether it reads zero, in order to check if it has been calibrated correctly.<span id='TIOjyKjE9'/>
    - Data<span id='Q9cr-wHFB'/>
        - Information, either qualitative or quantitative, that has been collected.<span id='4hiKx-GNx'/>
    - Error<span id='iDf8jhw5X'/>
        - See also **uncertainty**.<span id='6Jze8Ctg3'/>
        - Measurement error<span id='UXUf132vN'/>
            - The difference between a measured value and the true value.<span id='PmXXsJy3H'/>
        - Anomalies<span id='pl_kH2i_8'/>
            - These are values in a set of results which are judged not to be part of the variation caused by random **uncertainty**.<span id='98E1t39FG'/>
        - Random error<span id='gdWmv9L3r'/>
            - These cause readings to be spread about the true value, due to results varying in an unpredictable way from one measurement to the next. Random errors are present when any measurement is made, and cannot be corrected. The effect of random errors can be reduced by making more measurements and calculating a new mean.<span id='lrL1DYCmZ'/>
        - Systematic error<span id='0zSS2DuOp'/>
            - These cause readings to differ from the true value by a consistent amount each time a measurement is made. Sources of systematic error can include the environment, methods of observation or instruments used. Systematic errors cannot be dealt with by simple repeats. If a systematic error is suspected, the data collection should be repeated using a different technique or a different set of equipment, and the results compared.<span id='Gwbyv82AL'/>
        - Zero error<span id='IP3AuwSb-'/>
            - Any indication that a measuring system gives a false reading when the true value of a measured quantity is zero, eg the needle on an ammeter failing to return to zero when no current flows. A zero error may result in a systematic **uncertainty**.<span id='P67bX2xy9'/>
    - Evidence<span id='-c2hRslOL'/>
        - Data which has been shown to be valid.<span id='ClXLGm2Iw'/>
    - Fair test<span id='ElJwnN3vK'/>
        - A fair test is one in which only the independent variable has been allowed to affect the dependent variable.<span id='JuUSwa-es'/>
    - Hypothesis<span id='3DsyidydH'/>
        - A proposal intended to explain certain facts or observations.<span id='MQ7_1O7Hm'/>
    - Interval<span id='516SUJHlK'/>
        - The quantity between readings, eg a set of 11 readings equally spaced over a distance of 1 metre would give an interval of 10 centimetres.<span id='3X_jrJ1k4'/>
    - **precision**<span id='JpD0DDyT8'/>
        - Precise measurements are ones in which there is very little spread about the mean value. **precision** depends only on the extent of random errors – it gives no indication of how close results are to the true value.<span id='1ogllP9-0'/>
    - Prediction<span id='E1tDeLtCb'/>
        - A prediction is a statement suggesting what will happen in the future, based on observation, experience or a hypothesis.<span id='NVl20LMBD'/>
    - Range<span id='C3QT046Ae'/>
        - The maximum and minimum values of the independent or dependent variables; important in ensuring that any pattern is detected. For example a range of distances may be quoted as either: 'From 10 cm to 50 cm' or 'From 50 cm to 10 cm'.<span id='5r5fTfa0s'/>
    - Repeatable<span id='At5vWlbo_'/>
        - A measurement is repeatable if the original experimenter repeats the investigation using same method and equipment and obtains the same results. Previously known as reliable.<span id='7LXICitDY'/>
    - Reproducible<span id='MAW6WPq0x'/>
        - A measurement is reproducible if the investigation is repeated by another person, or by using different equipment or techniques, and the same results are obtained. Previously known as reliable.<span id='ocIIeaxze'/>
    - Resolution<span id='fq23whnym'/>
        - This is the smallest change in the quantity being measured (input) of a measuring instrument that gives a perceptible change in the reading.<span id='9VcCnZFzh'/>
    - Sketch graph<span id='tPiQnzyM0'/>
        - A line graph, not necessarily on a grid, that shows the general shape of the relationship between two variables. It will not have any points plotted and although the axes should be labelled they may not be scaled.<span id='iBfazMgND'/>
    - True value<span id='ANEFKQCOf'/>
        - This is the value that would be obtained in an ideal measurement.<span id='ZC8Y3kBBu'/>
    - **uncertainty**<span id='trcCOxNn4'/>
        - The interval within which the true value can be expected to lie. Whenever a measurement is made, there will always be some **uncertainty** or doubt about the result obtained. **uncertainty** can be expressed in terms of spread of values obtained. For example, a length of 56 cm ±2 cm would mean the true value could be anywhere between 54 cm and 58 cm.<span id='raorsshYq'/>
    - Validity<span id='hr7VCRrSr'/>
        - Suitability of the investigative procedure to answer the question being asked. For example, an investigation to find out if the rate of a chemical reaction depended upon the concentration of one of the reactants would not be a valid procedure if the temperature of the reactants was not controlled.<span id='BH-LR6UMS'/>
    - Valid conclusion<span id='be3zR_pOG'/>
        - A conclusion supported by valid data, obtained from an appropriate experimental design and based on sound reasoning.<span id='VF1qsqVwI'/>
    - Variables<span id='w-3HxLTRD'/>
        - These are physical, chemical or biological quantities or characteristics.<span id='NObU2ohhm'/>
        - Categoric<span id='LDtZgPVO2'/>
            - Categoric variables have values that are labels, eg names of plants or types of material.<span id='Hs4PrWWJM'/>
        - Continuous<span id='os0NY5l2L'/>
            - Continuous variables can have values (called a quantity) that can be given a magnitude either by counting (as in the case of the number of shrimp) or by measurement (eg light intensity, flow rate etc). Previously known as discrete variable.<span id='ZyQpRNqBe'/>
        - Control<span id='RcBIJx2hh'/>
            - Control variable is one which may, in addition to the independent variable, affect the outcome of the investigation and therefore has to be kept constant or at least monitored.<span id='VNqSs1ar8'/>
        - Dependent<span id='8gpMbdyOh'/>
            - Dependent variable is the variable of which the value is measured for each and every change in the independent variable.<span id='1iRu6TvsP'/>
        - Independent<span id='lHWdYbYol'/>
        - Independent variable is the variable for which values are changed or selected by the investigator.<span id='gurOJbSvy'/>
