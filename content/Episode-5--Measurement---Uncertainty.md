- Introduction to the topic as stated in the syllabus:<span id='LxfAW1WCa'/>
- T - **Measurement** is essential to the study of [[Physics]]. Physicists need to be familiar with a wide range of measuring instruments.<span id='vAinT4Q61'/>
- H - **Measurement**s themselves may be misleading and result in inappropriate conclusions as a result of errors and uncertainties. This **Episode** develops an understanding of errors and uncertainties in measured and derived physical quantities.<span id='um_ScLm2n'/>

    - **What are the typical mistakes to avoid, pitfalls to look out?**<span id='H4Y57fe1G'/>
- So let’s get cracking…<span id='QnKM8H22U'/>
- **T - What’s the big idea?**<span id='GVfZVlxSR'/>
- H - The big idea is simply that there are techniques we can use when we measure things that can help give more meaning to our results.<span id='GCJunZaAJ'/>
- The key concept is that there are factors that influence the extent to which we can have confidence in the numbers we record in our **Measurement**.<span id='yYsRqPUvT'/>
- The big three factors are the design of the experiment itself, the appropriateness of the measuring instruments selected, and the human technique with which the **Measurement**s are taken.<span id='MHTwibcvn'/>
- **T - Why are these important?**<span id='Ek4Lp6Ddp'/>
- H - In the previous **Episode** we talked a lot about meaningfulness and in particular, the idea that numbers without units had no meaning to the physicist. In this **Episode** we take this issue a stage further and boldly state that numbers with no idea of confidence in their **accuracy** are also meaningless.<span id='aJ0zQDHti'/>
- T - What do you mean by that exactly?<span id='rX7ZvDUMM'/>
- H - Well, for example if I told you that I was 72, you would probably say ‘72 what?’<span id='ZP7UQ1z-n'/>
- I could be 72 years old, 72 inches tall, 72 kilograms in mass.<span id='5rtBd7phV'/>
- T - Yep, that all makes sense. So, let’s say you were talking about your mass, and you stated that you were 72 kilograms. Why is that in itself not meaningful to the physicist? I mean, I have a pretty good idea of how hard it would be to lift someone who says that their mass number is 72 kilograms right?<span id='yiF9i_Su0'/>
- H - Absolutely you do, and for the average person in the street that’s more than enough to be useful. But physicists need a lot more than that. They need to know how confident you are in that number in order to know how deeply to trust that number themselves and the extent to which they can use this number when looking for patterns, drawing conclusions and generating predictions.<span id='cHVOSdoIR'/>
- T - What do you mean by that exactly?<span id='Lmu3josGo'/>
- H - For example, if I said that I went on my bathroom scales and looking down on the scale I could see that my mass was a little over 70 kilograms, you would have a certain level of confidence in my mass number.<span id='jSI0R2Jm7'/>
- H - However, if I was in training for an olympic boxing event and my coach was recording my mass on a finely tuned olympic standard mass scale, every day at the same time, for the last 6 months, and the average of my mass number over this period was 72.00 kilograms, you would have a different level of confidence in my mass number.<span id='BJ0pRJW9_'/>
- T - But does that really make much difference?<span id='FJSC0CGkF'/>
- H  - Well, it turns out that it does make a huge difference to our ability to draw meaningful conclusions from our **Measurement**s.<span id='iNcxabhCP'/>
- T - **OK, so what’s our starting point?**<span id='AhT88uyxw'/>
- H - One starting point is the design of the experiment and how likely our experiment is to give us numbers that we can be confident in.<span id='L6p7G8Jks'/>
- T - So, for example, let’s say we are trying to measure the speed of a snail by measuring how far it moved in one second. We would need to accurately record the snail’s start position and then, after exactly one second had elapsed, we would need to record the snail’s new position. And we’ve planned to do it with a tape measure. How confident do you think we could be with the distance number we got? How meaningful do you think our number for the speed of the snail would be?<span id='GyQtZ5fer'/>
- H - Right. So, the design of the experiment is very important. Part of the design of the experiment is the measuring equipment we choose. These things are related, because, you’re not really ever conducting an experiment without taking a **Measurement**. If you are, that’s fine, it’s just not an experiment.<span id='dNY1rI1Qf'/>
- T - So, we could have a perfectly well thought out experiment but with the wrong measuring apparatus?<span id='dG0Pc6FTs'/>
- H - Well, yes, you could - although that’s really part of the experiment design. For example, if I said that we would aim to measure the speed of a snail by seeing how far it moved down a garden path in a period of one hour, it would have a chance of being a more meaningful experiment. But we could still mess it up by using the wrong equipment to measure the distance travelled.<span id='9OCrTYJ0s'/>
- T - OK, yes, so you could measure the distance travelled with a trundle wheel, but that wouldn’t be accurate enough to give a meaningful answer (a trundle wheel is a rotating wheel of known circumference that you might use for measuring the perimeter of a football field)<span id='YtLfvAe3B'/>
- H - Precisely. Similarly a micrometer wouldn’t be a sensible measuring device either since the **precision** required to be meaningful in this context would not be of the order of one thousandth of a millimetre.<span id='Yz6PHJl5Z'/>
- T - Anything else we need to know before we bring in anything new?<span id='h7zCInyUT'/>
- H - Absolutely. We need to know about significant figures, percentages and simple manipulations with numbers like how to round up and down.<span id='HgDo02xQ9'/>
- **T - What new things do we need to introduce and define?**<span id='3hAmqJomE'/>
- H - We introduce two new concepts that most GCSE students will not have encountered before: **uncertainty** and Errors.<span id='QaM94apt2'/>
- The **uncertainty** in a **Measurement** represents how sure we are that the true value of our **Measurement** is between two limits.<span id='ldo1OoU95'/>
- T - OK, so if I say that my height is 1.82 metres plus or minus 0.01 metres it means that I believe the most likely value for my height is 1.82 metres, and that I am very confident that my height is not more than 1.83 metres and not less than 1.81 metres.<span id='0hY68tlYd'/>
- H - Precisely. This estimate of the **uncertainty** in our **Measurement**s is a critical aspect for the physicist and it is a good idea to get very comfortable with this concept.<span id='LNNiqAQTp'/>
- T - So, how do we estimate this **uncertainty**?<span id='OJr1VIOTK'/>
- H - We think about the **precision** of the measuring equipment we are using. The **precision** of a measuring device is the finest gradation of its measuring system. A metre rule has gradations of a millimetre, so the **uncertainty** of a **Measurement** using a meter rule is plus or minus 1 millimetre.<span id='jF1cwKqHE'/>
- T - right, like a standard mercury thermometer measures temperature to the nearest degree, so it would make sense to state your **Measurement** as plus or minus 1 degree Celsius.<span id='zwkOxgTMV'/>
- T - OK, so what about when you are adding **Measurement**s?<span id='wxBzgVU9E'/>
- H - Well, this is pretty simple, your total **uncertainty** is just the **uncertainty** of all the individual **Measurement**s.<span id='y8se4kJFn'/>
- T - OK, so let’s say I am measuring the four edges of a table and then adding these distances together to work out the perimeter of the table. I just add the uncertainties in each side together to get the total **uncertainty**?<span id='fuyY_Ktzm'/>
- H - Yes, that’s right. So, if each side has an **uncertainty** of 0.01 metres, and I add together the four **Measurement**s, the total **uncertainty** in the perimeter is 0.04 metres.<span id='jjw2bJEtZ'/>
- T - OK, so that’s uncertainties in **Measurement**s, what about uncertainties in quantities that are derived from **Measurement**s?<span id='Nr_iacnRH'/>
- H - For example, if you are trying to work out the [[**Velocity**]] of a train and you measured it as taking 7.2 seconds to move a distance of 240 metres, we would need to know the **uncertainty** of each **Measurement** in order to calculate the **uncertainty** in the total [[**Velocity**]].<span id='PM39-OWT9'/>
- We do this using the concept of percentage **uncertainty** and we add the percentage **uncertainty** in the two **Measurement**s we take to find the percentage **uncertainty** in the [[**Velocity**]].<span id='_qliFI2Hs'/>
- Let’s say we estimate the **uncertainty** in the time to be around 0.1 seconds and the **uncertainty** in the distance to be 1 metre, we then calculate the percentage **uncertainty** in the time as 0.1 seconds divided by 7.2 seconds times 100.<span id='1UZZQ4-OG'/>
- That approach gives a percentage error of 1.4% in the time **Measurement** and a percentage error of 0.42% in the **Measurement** of distance.<span id='v9mlwf6NE'/>
- T - In terms of meaningfulness, since these are estimates, 1 significant figure is usually enough for a percentage **uncertainty** and so we say that there is 1% error in the time and a 0.4% error in the distance giving a total percentage error of 1.4% by adding them together.<span id='r7u4LtDlE'/>
- H - Right, So then we calculate the final answer.<span id='izLaI3X0j'/>
- Since [[**Velocity**]] is distance divided by time, we divide 240 metres by 7.2 seconds to get 33.3 metres per second (answer to three significant figures) with a percentage **uncertainty** of 1.4%.<span id='e8Ix32gWN'/>
- We can then use this percentage **uncertainty** to give an absolute **uncertainty** in terms of metres per second.<span id='CvhKK_L6I'/>
- 33.3 metres per second times 1.4% = 0.47 metres per second.<span id='8MEw9Naup'/>
- T - Great, we can now quote our calculation for the speed of the train as 33.3 metres per second plus or minus 0.5 metres per second. (It’s usually not meaningful to quote the error in the answer to more than one significant figure.)<span id='A9YaVdrox'/>
- T - OK, so that’s uncertainties taken care of. What about errors?<span id='3gzZ0Ucht'/>
- H - Well, there are two types of errors: Errors in the system, which are called **systematic** errors and errors due to randomness which are called **random** errors.<span id='VWFIelcMw'/>
- A systematic error could be any of the following:<span id='7vJ87D5Li'/>
- You use a ruler which had the wrong markings on it, or that’s not actually the correct length.<span id='p2JPwJS3g'/>
- Your mass balance registers a value when there is nothing actually on it. This is called a zero error. (Other zero errors can occur for example when measuring electric currents with an ammeter you get a non-zero reading, even when there is no current flowing.)<span id='rOVk5nFAX'/>
- You are using a hand-held stopwatch to measure time and you don’t allow for your reaction time.<span id='yPb89I0gY'/>
- T - These are all errors that are in the system. The errors come from either the design of the experiment itself, from faulty equipment or through equipment being used in the wrong way by the experimenter.<span id='eYYvwoxHS'/>
- A systematic error in a particular experiment distorts the experimental results in the same way, i.e. it always gives an answer which is too low or too high, but not both.<span id='BVFhqLJl-'/>
- H - A random error is an error that is equally likely to be too low or too high and occurs when **Measurement**s are taken by experimenters. Random errors cannot be avoided but they can be significantly reduced by taking multiple readings.<span id='7v538-cvh'/>
- **T - In summary, what do we need to know about errors?**<span id='GTPEb7FKr'/>
- H - We need to know how to avoid systematic error by checking our equipment and by carefully thinking through our experiment design.<span id='wqWq7wRab'/>
- H - We need to know how to reduce random error by taking multiple readings and by repeating the entire experiment.<span id='tuQbu5QHJ'/>
- T - Great stuff, that’s all we’ve got time for in Part 1. So We’ll pick this up in Part 2 by talking about the difference between **accuracy** and **precision**…<span id='xXrMMbrWS'/>
- H - Sounds interesting. See you then.<span id='dvrQxNcbx'/>
