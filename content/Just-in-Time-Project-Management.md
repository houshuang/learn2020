    - <a id='zhiFOzlWr'/>are there still valuable intermediate packets that are not public (ie. [[Zettelkasten]], also ref ((Ce2MvOaCb))
    - <a id='SFC6CzQVU'/><a id='UWWz3uJJC'/>&#8203;<mark>This is assuming you have an audience - easy for Tiago to put something out there, even a tweetstorm. If I publish a blog, and nobody reads it? If I write something, and nobody in my company has the time to provide feedback? If the people I need feedback from (academic colleagues) are too busy to provide feedback on drafts?</mark>
    - <a id='9WAoGcrO1'/>Attempt many different projects network etc, however <a id='u6mTtGbNz'/>&#8203;<mark>However, definitively danger in spreading yourself too thin, getting involved in too many networks. At least in academia, visibility etc are all good, but at the end of the day, only journal articles count. Probably different for entrepreneurs. Even there though - being known as an expert on something, as opposed to knowing a bit of everything, in this world where there are so many experts on everything... Finding a niche.</mark>
