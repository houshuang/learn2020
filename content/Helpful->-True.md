title: "Helpful > True"
---

- One of [[The CASSIDY Method]] philosophies, it's more interesting to focus on how helpful something is rather than agonising over the extent to which it is true.<span id='ajnrDpqIY'/>
- This clearly doesn't mean that people should believe things which are knowingly false, merely that they don't need to expend a great deal of effort on proving a thing is true. The fact that something is helpful is a more valuable paradigm.<span id='i6c7zCQAr'/>
