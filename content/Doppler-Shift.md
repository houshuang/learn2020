title: "Doppler Shift"
---

- If a wave source is moving relative to an observer, there will be a change in the observed frequency and wavelength due to a phenomenon called the doppler effect.<span id='E68jGhbAC'/>
- An example of this is when the siren of an ambulance sounds increasingly high-pitched as the ambulance approaches you, and lower-pitched as it moves away from you.<span id='K7Me7TPPX'/>

- The light we observe from distant galaxies is shifted towards the red end of the visible spectrum and is thus called a #Red-shift. This means that the frequency is lower than we expect, and correspondingly the wavelength is higher than we would have expected, since the [[**Velocity**]] of the light waves is considered to be constant: ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2F0qRc8UjBDc?alt=media&token=992a83e7-f643-485f-aa7e-50bb0b67a3b0)<span id='RCR6B0k0H'/>

- The faster it is moving, the more its light is red-shifted.<span id='rzTW3Elvc'/>
