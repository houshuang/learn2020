        - The idea of concept-handles is itself a concept-handle; it means a catchy phrase that sums up a complex topic.
        - Eliezer Yudkowsky is really good at this. “belief in belief“, “semantic stopsigns“, “applause lights“, “Pascal’s mugging“, “adaptation-executors vs. fitness-maximizers“, “reversed stupidity vs. intelligence“, “joy in the merely real” – all of these are interesting ideas, but more important they’re interesting ideas with short catchy names that everybody knows, so we can talk about them easily.

- I definitively see this in relationship with Roam and note taking - 7 years ago I had vague ideas but nothing to pin it on. Now I can just say Zettelkasten, and a group of people are onboard (but many others are lost)
    - Interesting also how different intellectuals become known for a single concept, like ZPD...

    - or the spatial relationship when talking - I'll park a concept here #missingLink
- Questions
    - What kinds of concepts does this work well for? What kinds of hooks? Are there concepts I have that I could do this with?
    - What happens if concept is watered out/changed? Appropriated?
        - gay, n**er, metoo
    - How do you fight against it if its unfair?
        - liberal latte-drinking East coast elite snowflakes
- Etymology
    - [[Awakening From the Meaning Crisis]] focuses a lot on the etymology of words, like staying the course.
