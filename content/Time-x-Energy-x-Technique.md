- #TIME x #ENERGY x #TECHNIQUE<span id='ghXDVtN-F'/>
- You don’t want to just throw more time at problems. You also don’t want to burn yourself out, just throwing your energy into things. Your results are a combination of time, energy, and technique. By using more effective techniques, you can amplify your results. This is how you use your time and energy more effectively.<span id='G61SdRRkz'/>
- #TIME<span id='RyrbBg7DJ'/>
- Time is a First-Class Citizen.<span id='Mb4rLxFqf'/>
- Time is a great way to prioritize.  For example, there is only so much you can do in a day.   You can use different time horizons to plot out what you’d like to achieve within the time that you actually have.<span id='HfZ1gi8EI'/>
- Time is also a great foundation to build your time management upon.   That’s why the backbone of Agile Results is the Monday Vision, Daily Outcomes, Friday Reflection pattern.   The days of the week are durable.  What you do with them is up to you.   In this way, time is your foundation and platform for results.<span id='fiBEGruss'/>
- The most important insight though, is that time changes what’s important.  That’s why “To Do” lists get stale, and you can quickly find yourself buried in a mound of irrelevant burden.   The trick is to take a fresh look, each day, each week, each month, each year to see what matters now.  You can also use this to look ahead and anticipate value.   What will matter next month or next quarter or next year?   You can use time to better understand value, and to help you make trade-offs among where to spend your time.<span id='fv9XLlHy6'/>
- #ENERGY<span id='gzJH9DrbU'/>
- Energy is Your Force Multiplier.<span id='63QjDG5Vu'/>
- You don’t get more hours in a day.  But you can change your energy.   And, if you use your best energy, you can amplify your impact in powerful ways.<span id='nwX7e4Fio'/>
- How do you change your energy?  You can draw from your mind, body, or emotions.  For example, if you connect what you do with your passion, you can find your drive from the inside out.  If you link what you do to good feelings, you can create habits that your body will want to do. You can use your thoughts to change your feelings, and operate at a higher level.<span id='x8RE5nZdC'/>
- #TECHNIQUE<span id='lBdE10PZG'/>
- All the time in the world, with all the energy in the world, still won’t be effective if you have the wrong technique.<span id='0rA2nP_qJ'/>
- If you wanted to throw the javelin and didn’t have an expert guiding you with the correct technique, it would be a disaster. You’d get very tired, dejected and despite having great strength, you’d get beaten by someone half your size with good technique.<span id='SXfvBXRVa'/>
