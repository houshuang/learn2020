- Overview of Day 3: Assimilate the Analogies<span id='7kRjEpgzf'/>
    - Key Objectives<span id='MeeW7WvW_'/>
        - 1. It's a bit like...<span id='gW8SJgLZs'/>
            - We use sophisticated analogy-making techniques and team strategies like Jigsaw Learning to accelerate the assimilation of the concepts, to absorb mentally the abstractions. To go from the Known to the Unknown, to embody the concepts deeply by relating them to existing experiences. We seek to develop an intuition for the topics, to answer the ALIKENESS question: Ok, so what is it LIKE?<span id='_YnTEqdQp'/>
        - 2. DRAW IT!<span id='x4kOxjveY'/>
            - The third day is all about understanding. Students must be able to summarise each concept on demand, using self-drawn diagrams to support their explanations.<span id='iMmXPwUZE'/>
    - Background<span id='e9JnygRug'/>
        - So, what do we mean by analogy?<span id='rEgsYyXB_'/>
            - Analogy is a sort of similarity. Similar objects agree with each other in some respect, analogous objects agree in certain relations of their respective parts.<span id='bAlXVl5he'/>

            - On Analogy in Learning - from Better Explained by [[Kalid Azad]]<span id='kBv1aDsUP'/>

                - Why do analogies work so well? They’re building blocks for our thoughts, written in the associative language of our brains.<span id='lE6Vvezew'/>
                - At first, I thought analogies had to be perfect models of the idea they explained. Nope.<span id='LqddBF0WT'/>
                - __“All models are wrong, but some are useful” – George Box__<span id='oQdEjcfSA'/>
                - Analogies are handles to grasp a larger, more slippery idea. They’re a raft to cross a river, and can be abandoned once on the other side. Unempathetic experts may think the raft is useless, since they no longer use it, or perhaps they were such marvelous swimmers it was never needed!<span id='f7zvgzRES'/>
                - Analogies are perfectly fine. But why do they work so well?<span id='UAXKvUoMS'/>
                - Our brains are association machines. Connections, relationships, patterns — we need meaning! Yet we present topics as if we could be programmed with raw information.<span id='yjqHV9cn4'/>
                - Consider the typical language class:<span id='kerRhAOth'/>
                    - Here’s the grammar<span id='IDULLJXdV'/>
                    - Here’s the vocabulary<span id='I0d9XBYSz'/>
                    - Put the vocab in the grammar and go!<span id='FioBv9rV3'/>
                - We know how well that works. The mistake is thinking direct study of the grammar and vocabulary will build fluency — it’s a tough slog. I suspect a class of 80% speaking, listening, making idioms, building pronunciation and 20% vocabulary/grammar does much better than the reverse.<span id='zWGI-YC5Z'/>
                - Start with simple analogies you deeply understand, then attach extra details.<span id='1H2MB-OyP'/>
                - Here’s an example: I can casually describe i (the [imaginary number](https://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-intuitive-guide-to-imaginary-numbers/)) as the square root of -1 and you can blindly accept it.<span id='t4TSF-ag8'/>
                - But you won’t really believe me until I start down the path of “Hey, numbers can be 2 dimensional, and i is a rotation into the 2nd dimension”. The word “rotation” stretches our brain about what a number could be — the number line may not be the final step. We’re having a real discussion and can start learning!<span id='v2y7WAWFe'/>
                - See, you’re extremely fluent with the idea of a line, and the idea of a second dimension, and we can work “i is a rotation” into that framework. In computer terms: we are programming with the native language of the machine. Our brain thinks with connections, so explain new data in terms of existing connections!<span id='XA6sc37XH'/>
                - Although a subject can be distilled into rules and facts, drinking this concentrated math isn’t the best way to enjoy it. It’s not how our brains work, and presenting raw data suffers from a painful translation step.<span id='iu6Y9mdp4'/>
                - I don’t think of algebra, trig and other math as a table of equations. It’s a web of connections and insights. But why show facts and hope you recreate the mental model in my head, instead of describing it directly?<span id='EtbH5CAw5'/>
                - No, no — let’s have a brain-to-brain. Here’s the analogies in my head, I want you to have them too.<span id='BpBMFIn7G'/>
            - A nice summary of the power of analogy in teaching here: https://www.teachthought.com/critical-thinking/types-of-analogies/<span id='7uVk4HfWH'/>
- Timetable to Day 3<span id='mfbwNR-vz'/>
- 1000 - 1130<span id='8ndTbjWC9'/>
    - 1. Topic Level: Students create a [[topic map]] for all the major topics detailed in the [[subject map]] from Day 2.<span id='y4nivFBsz'/>
    - Students create analogies for each major topic area using the [Teach to Six]] framework for a high level view of the topic:<span id='9Alm4vDhr'/>
        - [[Teach to Six]] is a valuable technique from the [[Talk for Learning]] philosophy. It's a structure that makes it easy to see how well you understand a topic/concept/idea.<span id='4YY0tQ7D6'/>
        - The idea comes from the quote (possibly wrongly) attributed to Einstein<span id='dY_xNLz8H'/>
            - __If you can't explain it to a six year old then you don't understand it properly yourself__<span id='K9VUZAl2A'/>
        - SIX acts as a useful mnemonic for the process.<span id='WYVtxasTC'/>
        - **S - Simple Language.**<span id='XN9jpndgr'/>
            - Students are forbidden from using any words in their explanations that would be outside the vocabulary of a typical six year old.<span id='5on1nu0Ci'/>
            - This reinforces Feynman’s and Einstein’s approaches and avoids students masking their lack of deep understanding of a topic by using technical language.<span id='yrj5m7hUz'/>
            - A key question to ask is this:<span id='0R4LpIFGv'/>
            - Does the introduction of this word add any understanding? Or is it just a definition?<span id='6SVFwpmiq'/>
        - **I - It's a bit like...**<span id='XxY7HXIwX'/>
            - This is the concept of Analogy. It's far better to say what things are like than to introduce them 'in vacuo'. This is what all learners do anyway whenever you are introducing them to a new concept.<span id='wt2o-yuaj'/>
            - The mind is constantly trying to make sense of the new information in relation to all the information it currently has.<span id='ChONeK3G0'/>
            - A deliberate use of analogy can ease this transition, especially if many different analogies are used.<span id='iRV1Vy7MI'/>
        - **X - eXamples**<span id='E1wmhRtCr'/>
            - It's a bit of a fudge, but examples are so important.<span id='2ANNbwtzC'/>
            - Newton famously said 'Examples are of more use than precepts when learning the sciences.'<span id='K4rWdWYrZ'/>
            - It's critical to remind the explainer that examples are key to embed this learning into the learner's set of well-understood concepts.<span id='i_Ihr79VS'/>
            - So, the Teach to Six Framework provides a systematic way of making sure all students become expert explainers.<span id='2T-kT8opD'/>
- 1130 - 1300<span id='8rrO8khLu'/>
    - 2. Now we move down the hierarchy to the level of the node. We map concepts at [[node map]] level until each node in each [[topic map]] has been completed.<span id='Dt3whGV7O'/>
    - At Node Level, more detail is helpful, so we tend to use the [[ADEPT Method]] to give us a richer perspective. [[Teach to Six]] is still valuable and a legitimate tool for a simplified understanding and appropriate for the more straightforward academic subjects.<span id='544CqdmUn'/>
    - This is a summary of the ADEPT Method process:<span id='aG4N74XAP'/>
