- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='FXgD0VevW'/>
- Introduction to the topic as stated in the syllabus:<span id='6vp818sXy'/>
- T - (Key Points from overview document)<span id='yNZx_LpHG'/>
- Kinematics is the study of motion. Movement is part of everyday experience, so it is important to be able to analyse and predict the way in which objects move.<span id='ceXe_Cvp3'/>
- H - The behaviour of moving objects is studied both graphically and through equations of motion. Clearly, we won’t be showing any graphs on these podcasts but we will be getting you to imagine what the graphs will look like from real object movement.<span id='vweK4M__h'/>
- T - Here are the essential questions that serve as a roadmap for how we’re covering all the topics in this podcast series. Not all topics will fit the roadmap exactly, but the questions serve as signposts as we journey through each topic.<span id='cvqXk8MgF'/>
- Here’s the roadmap:<span id='J6ilFIbDd'/>

- **What are the typical mistakes to avoid, pitfalls to look out for in this topic?**<span id='3WnWDHIxj'/>
- So let’s get cracking…<span id='3gNOs_ATb'/>
- **T - What’s the big idea? What is Kinematics all about?**<span id='M_eElkTIh'/>
- H - This is actually a fancy word to describe the study of things that are moving. In particular we ignore the **force**s that might be causing this motion. The study of the **force**s involved comes in the next episode, when we move on to the topic called ‘Dynamics’<span id='V0RHkCIGi'/>
- **T - Why is it important?**<span id='Oa-zY77VY'/>
- H - Humans are good at spotting patterns and one thing we are particularly good at is the ability to detect changes in situations. For evolutionary reasons this was clearly a good idea as we began to develop the ability as an organism to move around.<span id='aFQ5j7hRk'/>
- T - Yes of course. Let’s imagine we are looking at a sabre-tooth tiger that is changing in apparent size. It would be helpful to avoid death if we realised that the change in apparent size was due to the tiger moving closer towards us and not due to it spontaneously expanding its own volume.<span id='Fvv-ywiEw'/>
- H - Of course, much of this we will pick up from experience. We get a feel for how fast things change position by playing around, by throwing things, and by ourselves moving. It turns out that there are certain rules for how things move that are helpful in predicting where things are going to end up after a certain time has elapsed.<span id='arqzWHWRZ'/>
- T - Yep, this is the sort of thinking that got humans to the moon.<span id='OtRp47HDR'/>
- H - Well, there’s a lot of dynamics involved in that too, but for sure, the way things move when they are under the influence of a uniform gravitational field is pretty helpful.<span id='YuB-h6aQy'/>
- **T - So, what’s our starting point?**<span id='LOrqK8XDi'/>
- H - We need to know the basic idea of distance, speed, time and **Acceleration** from GCSE [[Physics]].<span id='X1BDp4kX2'/>
- **T - What new things do we need to introduce and define?**<span id='sgf09bRE8'/>
- H - We need to start bringing in the difference between scalars and vectors.<span id='T5wgr_9nO'/>
- In episode 1c, we talked about the concepts of Scalars and Vectors and now we get a chance to see why they’re a good idea.<span id='HaIKdPHOZ'/>
- T - So, we introduce the new vector concepts of **Displacement** and [[**Velocity**]] and define them as this:<span id='UXJUf46m0'/>
- H- Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion. ****Displacement**** is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's overall change in position. How far is it now displaced from its starting point. **Displacement** is given in terms of a direction.<span id='xmVa1VS-d'/>
- T- Let me explain:<span id='s0e_TJGD-'/>
- Imagine you had a football in a soccer match. At the start of the match, the ball is on the centre spot. If I then said, the ball is now kicked and it moves a distance of 30 metres, how helpful would that piece of information be?<span id='1kKRI3j_X'/>
- Exactly. Not very useful. As a football fan, you would want to know a little more than how much ground the ball has covered. You would want to know which direction the ball had moved. For example if the ball has moved 30 metres in the direction of the opposition’s goal and away from your own goal, you would be much happier.<span id='QUia3LB3T'/>
- H- So in summary, **Displacement** is a vector quantity, which as we covered earlier has both a number telling you how big it is (a magnitude) and a direction.<span id='a8-6cbZfU'/>
- So, let's move on to [[**Velocity**]]. [[**Velocity**]] is thought of as distance divided by time, but this is actually wrong!<span id='_kw39605E'/>
- **[[**Velocity**]]** is a vector quantity and is to do with how the **Displacement** of an object varies over time in a given direction. This causes a huge number of problems for students of [[Physics]].<span id='tsovIMf4B'/>
- T- It might make sense to think of our football again.<span id='Q6Y-Zlpp9'/>
- The speed of an object is how much ground it covers in a certain time and the [[**Velocity**]] is ‘how much ground the ball has covered in a certain time in a particular direction’<span id='9VPj8PSVv'/>
- H - Again, it all comes down to the concept of meaningfulness. If I say that a tiger is moving at 10 metres per second, that doesn’t give you that much useful information. However, if I say that the tiger is moving towards **you** at 10 metres per second, you now have more useful information upon which to act.<span id='r_zErAw79'/>
- T - So, in the soccer match scenario, if a ball moves 30 metres in 3 seconds towards the opposition’s goal we can say that it is moving towards the opposition’s goal with a [[**Velocity**]] of 10 metres per second.<span id='3iEFeZhGH'/>
- H - For practical purposes, it’s not helpful to talk in terms of directions like ‘towards the opposition’s goal’ so we tend to define our directions as positive or negative along a number of axes, chosen to suit the situation.<span id='DgPOI9u_L'/>
- T - What do you mean by axes to suit the situation?<span id='lrJq7021o'/>
- H - Well, let’s say we are looking at the motion of an apple falling off a tree. The apple is moving along a straight line, which is from its starting position towards the centre of the earth. So, all we need to know is its **Displacement** along this single line - i.e. ‘up and down’ and we only need one number to describe how far out of place it is from its starting position.<span id='k5h8HTUXo'/>
- T - However, if we were playing ice-hockey, we might want to consider the **Displacement** of a hockey puck in two directions, forwards and backwards and side to side. So we would need two numbers to relate how far from its starting position the puck has traveled, in order to cover the two directions. These two directions are at right-angles to one another and so we use two axes which are at right-angles to one another. (We call these orthogonal axes and they are useful for describing motion in two dimensions.)<span id='sezNlmAx3'/>
- H - Similarly, if we were playing golf, we might want to describe the motion of the golf ball in three dimensions, so we would need to consider the distance moved both forward and backwards, side to side and up and down. Therefore we would need to use three numbers to consider the **Displacement** of the ball from its starting position. Three dimensions, three numbers, three axes.<span id='Nzqew8yha'/>
- T - The [[**Velocity**]] in each direction comes from measuring how far out of place in each direction the object is after a certain time has elapsed. The SI units of [[**Velocity**]] are metres per second.<span id='JELfwN77N'/>
- H - A more formal way of talking about the [[**Velocity**]] of an object is as ‘the object’s rate of change of **Displacement**’.<span id='Qo6wtjoXI'/>
- This means the same thing. It’s an idea of how quickly an object is changing its **Displacement**, but it introduces an idea that’s very important to physicists, the idea of the rate of change of a quantity.<span id='6JCdaXs5d'/>
- T - yes, a very important concept. ‘Rate of change’ is too big a topic to get into now, but it’s quite useful in everything from filling up a bath, to a nuclear explosion and we’ll do a lot on it later in this series.<span id='Fm3ADui4d'/>
- H - OK, so we have this idea of [[**Velocity**]] being the rate of change of **Displacement**. So what? How does this help us?<span id='L1NkQDWu7'/>
- T - Well, we can calculate stuff by knowing this relationship. If we can measure both an object’s change in **Displacement** and the time taken for this change to occur, we can work out an object’s [[**Velocity**]].<span id='i5Iqm3jQJ'/>
- H - So, we can turn these words into meaning, by making **Measurement**s and then doing a calculation.<span id='8p0SOLwyp'/>
- T - Precisely. Let’s imagine that the golf ball moves 120 metres towards the green in 2 seconds. Its [[**Velocity**]] can be worked out by dividing 120 metres by 2 seconds.<span id='dpTuyKP95'/>
- This gives a [[**Velocity**]] of 60 metres per second in the direction of the green.<span id='67f5p-HIq'/>
- H - Now, one interesting question we might want to know is this? ‘Does the golf ball stay at the same [[**Velocity**]] for its entire journey, or does its [[**Velocity**]] change along the journey, and if so, by how much?<span id='R31IHtVJ6'/>
- T - Yes, a great point. We know that the ball slows down at the end of its journey because we see it slowing down...<span id='PYownx6C0'/>
- H - And eventually it stops!<span id='RUOn3hP-R'/>
- T - Exactly. So in order for the ball to stop it must have ‘lost’ all of its [[**Velocity**]]. In order for it to move it must have ‘acquired’ some [[**Velocity**]], so we know that its [[**Velocity**]] must have changed.<span id='mRVHuy4vb'/>
- H - Sounds interesting. But, interesting as it appears, we don’t want the listeners to doze off, so we’ll pick this idea of how the [[**Velocity**]] of the golf ball changes in the next one.<span id='24MTBdhew'/>
- T - Great stuff. See you then.<span id='oHot_oWgX'/>
