- Introduction<span id='vd7WOlqof'/>
- T - In this topic, we’ll be having a look at what happens when you apply **force**s to solid objects without the objects changing their **Acceleration**.<span id='ABoAJRp73'/>
- H- Yes, basically so far we’ve thought of a **force** like gravity pulling an object like an apple towards the centre of the earth, usually stopped by the earth’s surface.<span id='cPJxsIyd4'/>
- T - And now we’re going to look at what happens to the apple itself if you apply a **force** to it when it isn’t able to move. It’s likely to change its shape, or become ‘deformed’.<span id='PELVi6-L0'/>
- H - Deformed just comes from ‘de’ and ‘formed’ and it means that the object’s physical shape is changed in some way.<span id='FdxAhwik3'/>
- T - Here’s what it says in the syllabus:<span id='VxqVgYJtn'/>
- Solids change their shape under the action of **force**s. This change may be large in the case of springs or hardly noticeable in some structures such as buildings.<span id='GD9sat3IH'/>
- H - The study of the deformation of solids is an important aspect of engineering. This topic provides an introduction to both elastic and plastic deformation of materials.<span id='g9xXPCyxz'/>
- Here’s the roadmap for the unit:<span id='ZpFDHpIWU'/>
- T - In this episode we’ll talk about the concepts of ‘stress’ and ‘strain’.<span id='V0Tprzvok'/>
- We’ll cover the idea that deformation is caused by a **force** and that, in one dimension, the deformation can be **tensile** (pulling) or **compressive (**pushing**)**<span id='MG4cQ7arw'/>
- H - We’ll describe the behaviour of springs in terms of load, extension, elastic limit, and introduce the idea of Hooke’s law and the spring constant (i.e. **force** per unit extension)<span id='kq5XZ5LyY'/>
- T - We’ll introduce the terms stress, strain and the Young modulus<span id='G5vaaPFMr'/>
- H - And we’ll point you in the direction of experiments you could do to determine a relationship between how much **force** you put onto a wire and how much it stretches. Something called the Young modulus of a metal.<span id='o0MBsZ7Ek'/>
- **T- Okay so what’s the big idea? What did we observe?**<span id='g1qUz2FXn'/>
- H- Well, the big idea is that a **force** can not only cause an object to change its **Acceleration**, but it can also change an object’s shape.<span id='lc2hCUrXn'/>
- T - Yep, we all know that when you bite into an apple you can break it apart. That’s all we are doing here. We push, pull and twist things and we have a look at what happens to them!<span id='Utg9vMRpm'/>
- H - Yes and we’ll be having a look at different types of materials and how they respond differently to **force**s. Some things stretch a lot, some things break easily.<span id='5x2SNIVcA'/>
- T - We introduce a few definitions of material behaviour: elastic, plastic, ductile and brittle<span id='5eUeFvlZJ'/>
- H - And we talk about how these behaviours make materials appropriate for particular jobs.<span id='0CEDYaAoD'/>
- T- Why is this an important area of [[Physics]]?<span id='veij8n_aI'/>
- H- Well, the study of materials under the application of **force**s is pretty much the whole of engineering. So if anyone wants to go into a career where you are building things, creating products, objects, stuff that people might actually USE, then this is quite a useful topic area.<span id='wZbhqg2rJ'/>
- T- Great stuff. So, let’s get started.<span id='dSEzQ7w8X'/>
- H - OK! The first thing we need to do is to define some words that we are going to introduce that have different meanings in regular English.<span id='BpFAab9eB'/>
- T - The word Stress is the first one. You’ve almost certainly heard that word in relation to something you experience when you’ve got a tricky situation coming up. Like an exam!<span id='YQgTG5tsx'/>
- H - However STRESS in [[Physics]] has a very particular meaning. (much like the word WORK)<span id='cbpmZ64pg'/>
- Stress is defined as ‘a measure of the **force** applied when a particular deformation occurs’<span id='6nLwgOVw1'/>
- T - So, it’s ‘how much **force** you are applying to the object’<span id='-F659WFvj'/>
- H - Yes. And what happens to the object as a result of this STRESS is called the STRAIN.<span id='A_MGM5GqG'/>
- Strain is defined as a measure of the degree of deformation.<span id='w66DEy5tp'/>
- T - This means how much the object changes its shape.<span id='hKy_BD03e'/>
- H - Yes, and we can link these two quantities together with the idea of an Elastic Modulus, which is simply the ratio of the two numbers that we would measure. The ratio of the Stress to the Strain.<span id='9yo33y4r-'/>
- The elastic modulus determines the amount of **force** required per unit deformation.<span id='Fdb01l50x'/>
- A material with a large elastic modulus will tend to resist a change in shape, while a material with a small elastic modulus will deform easily. They could both be elastic materials though, for example a spring changes shape easily, but a straight wire doesn’t. But they are both ‘elastic’ because they both tend to return to their original shape for small applications of **force**s.<span id='gr0HS9RDv'/>
- T - OK, that all seems pretty straightforward: You apply **force** to something, it changes shape, you measure both these numbers and this data gives you a way to compare materials.<span id='dxnbBW9kn'/>
- H - That’s basically it. Yes. The Elasticity of materials will be covered in the next episode, but it’s basically just a measure of how easily something changes its shape when a **force** is applied to it.<span id='VZ-g9zjhc'/>
- T - OK, so it seems pretty simple, let’s have a look at how we might be tested on this very simple concept.<span id='sK8PzuHsz'/>
- H - OK, so the first thing you might be asked to do is to see how the length of a wire changes when it is subjected to a stretching **force**.<span id='_U2_XSvlD'/>
- T - Yes, imagine you tried to pull a wire from both ends. If you pulled it hard enough in opposite directions it will stretch a little bit.<span id='hA_5cKUIi'/>
- H - We simply measure the **force** we applied and then how much the wire stretched and we do some calculations with these numbers.<span id='AHoFHCFK5'/>
- T - One important thing to make sure we are clear about is that how ‘thick’ the wire is makes a difference.<span id='IYP37vU5b'/>
- H - Yes, and that would seem pretty obvious right? If you are stretching a thin wire, you might expect it to be more easily lengthened than a thick wire. When we calculate the Stress, we divide the applied **force** by how ‘thick’ the wire is, so that we deal with the material itself and not one particular wire. In [[Physics]], the ‘thickness’ of a wire is called its ‘cross-sectional area’ which is usually the circular area you see if you slice a wire at right-angles to its length. This is a cross-section.<span id='RRt3eW2J6'/>
- T - In practice we just divide the **force** by the cross-sectional area of the wire to get the Stress.<span id='IGhaATnu5'/>
- H - Indeed the Tensile Stress is the stretching **force** applied to the wire divided by the wire’s cross-sectional area. Tensile just means ‘pulling’ and the Tensile ‘strength’ of a wire is the **force** you need to pull it so that it breaks.<span id='TiNZUN0l0'/>
- T - The fractional change in length that we observe is called the Tensile Strain. So the change in length divided by how long the wire was initially is the interesting quantity here.<span id='LhvSW-SJD'/>
- H - Of course it’s vital that we think of the fractional change of length because if a wire experiences a **force** of 1000 newtons per metre squared and changes length by 2 cm, it matters a great deal whether the wire was initially 10 cm long, or 100 m long!<span id='HaxTPcSYf'/>
- H - The ratio of Stress to Strain tells us something about the material and in the case of pulling **force**s (Tensile **force**s) we call this ratio the Young Modulus of the material.<span id='C5kJ9C0Ha'/>
- T - In summary, the Young Modulus is a number that tells us how easy a material will change its length under a stretching **force** and is given by Tensile Stress divided by Tensile Strain. A large number means it’s difficult to stretch it and a low number means it stretches easily.<span id='gDRlywCzG'/>
- H - OK, next up we’ll have a look at what happens when you apply **force**s to wires that are not straight.<span id='wlAd8RC1G'/>
- T - What do you mean exactly?<span id='F3FCEBhF_'/>
- H - Well, we’ve just had a look at pulling both ends of a straight wire and seeing what happens to the length of the wire, but quite often we don’t have a straight wire, we have a wire that is coiled up into a spring.<span id='15OpMYe4r'/>
- T - Yes, most of the experiments you do with this area of [[Physics]] involve applying **force**s to coiled wires, or springs, and seeing how they change their length.<span id='xX8HCQhrl'/>
- H - Springs are fun because they can be stretched, just like wires, under a Tensile **force**, but they can also be compressed by a compression **force**.<span id='lllznCvbR'/>
- T - A scientist named Robert Hooke did a lot of work with springs and came up with a law that became known as Hooke’s Law.<span id='Ou5dXA_dH'/>
- H - This law states that how much a spring changes its shape depends on how much **force** you apply to it. Or in more formal [[Physics]] terms: the extension (or compression) of a spring is proportional to the **force** applied to the spring<span id='y0dHj0nCN'/>
- ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2F3yie6GKcPU?alt=media&token=d4316784-3dfb-4840-9655-af34f6c71cbe)<span id='MvtpiwOSl'/>
- T - And this law holds pretty well for small **force**s. A **force** in this context is often called a ‘load’ which comes from the use of the word ‘load’ as something you carry.<span id='N-9-SJ-hg'/>
- H - So, for small loads Hooke’s Law is a good approximation. It works pretty well with springs and the extent to which a spring obeys Hooke’s Law is something we look at quite a lot in this area of [[Physics]].<span id='shJJBPpIm'/>
- T - And if something has a directly proportional relationship, we can write it in a standard way in [[Physics]], can’t we?<span id='P-9kNtUji'/>
- H - Indeed we can. Instead of saying the extension is proportional to the load, we can write a formula F = -kx, where F is the load, x is the extension, and -k is the ‘constant of proportionality’ between the two. Rearranging the equation, we can write k is equal to F/x, and so we get the idea of the idea of k as a measure of how much **force** you need to extend a spring by a given amount, and we think of this as the ‘stiffness’ of the spring.<span id='76jPp-a2Y'/>
- T - This got tricky all of a sudden.<span id='6x9b-Z1Mu'/>
- H - Well it’s certainly not tricky in terms of the maths. You measure the **force** (F) you apply to a spring, you measure the amount it extends its length (x) and you divide these two numbers to get a value for the ‘spring constant’ which we call ‘k’<span id='I3TNm84xT'/>
- T - Yes, so k is equal to F divided by x. OK, but why is it minus k then, and not just k?<span id='jaNYYuSgc'/>
- H - Good question. It’s really just a convention. The minus is because the **force** is acting in the opposite direction to the direction of extension. If you pull the spring ‘down’ the **force** that acts on the spring as a result of its ‘extended’ shape will act in the opposite direction to the extension and tend to ‘restore’ the spring to its original shape.<span id='ehjKnFCMK'/>
- T - Similarly if you compress a spring, the **force** on the spring as a result of its compression will tend to restore the spring to its original shape, working against the direction in which you applied the **force** to compress it in the first place.<span id='hTQ2SHSat'/>
- H - So, that’s why we write the formula as F equals minus k x.<span id='mfyvEuvi9'/>
- T - Hooke’s Law is a pretty nice one. You usually just extend a spring by adding a bunch of masses to it and record the length of the spring each time you add a new mass.<span id='z0rTatrNo'/>
- T - At some point the spring is likely to deform and beyond this point the spring won’t return to its original shape. It will have been permanently deformed. Up to this point, known as the elastic limit of the spring, even though the spring is extended, when the **force** is removed, the spring returns to its original shape.<span id='0Rd8Y1ELU'/>
- H - In this region, the spring is said to obey Hooke’s Law. As soon as the spring goes past its elastic limit, some of the atoms have been permanently moved in relation to each other and as a consequence, the spring no longer follows Hooke’s Law. If you plot all your data on a graph, you can identify that point and you can also work out the spring constant, k, by calculating the gradient of the line for the region where it is straight.<span id='6VkHsMQYj'/>
- T - This is the region where the spring obeys Hooke’s Law and -k is the gradient if you plot the extension on the x-axis and the **force** on the y-axis. NOTE this is not the usual way of doing [[Physics]] experiments. We usually put the variable that we are controlling on the x-axis. However, this will give you a gradient which is equal to the reciprocal of k, and not k itself. So, be careful to check your axes in questions on this. Especially lab work.<span id='ErjRx4ioh'/>
- H - And the final thing this episode is to let you know that we have added some resources that might be helpful regarding experiments you can do to explore Hooke’s Law, measure the Young Modulus of a material and to explore the energy stored in stretching materials.<span id='teAJKOMnJ'/>
- T - OK, nice one. In the next episode we’ll get onto a bit more about the concepts of plasticity, elastic limit and how to calculate the **work done** when you are stretching a spring. See you in the next one.<span id='zO-ZwZL3Y'/>
- H - See you then.<span id='eD3qS6exk'/>
