- Cosmology<span id='K8wS8VXqY'/>
    - The Big Bang theory states that the universe expanded outwards from a single point. Evidence for this theory includes:<span id='tHglIsYsc'/>
        - 1. Red shift - A [[Doppler Shift]] towards lower frequency light<span id='R-m9evcQg'/>
            - The red shift of light from galaxies shows that they are all moving away from us (and each other) and that those which are furthest away are moving the fastest, suggesting that the universe was formed from an explosion at a single point, strong evidence for the Big Bang.<span id='9uqNfYvP6'/>
        - 2. Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR)<span id='G_Uiox1pi'/>
            - Just after the Big Bang, lots of short wavelength radiation should have been released in all directions from a single, central point. This radiation, as the universe expanded over time, would have 'cooled down'. We would observe the effect of this cooling as the stretching of high frequency, short wavelength radiation to become low frequency, longer wavelength radiation, or microwaves.<span id='gELBIEI23'/>
            - The fact that there is cosmic microwave background radiation present in all directions, ()wherever you point a telescope in the sky) provides additional evidence for the Big Bang theory.<span id='FeBcXKeS5'/>
        - As the Big Bang theory is currently the only theory which accounts for all the experimental evidence, it is the most accepted model.<span id='2kcDpfkRI'/>
- Motion in the universe<span id='33oV-fQYJ'/>
    - The universe is a large collection of billions of galaxies.<span id='sUC03-AfT'/>
    - A galaxy is a large collection of billions of stars.<span id='VzNmFR-Aa'/>
    - Our solar system is in the Milky Way galaxy.<span id='qfGgO8nz6'/>
    - The gravitational field strength is the **force** per unit mass on a body in a gravitational field and is measured in Newtons per kilogram $$(N/kg)$$. It varies with the mass and size of the body and is therefore different on other planets and the moon compared to the Earth.<span id='qf4__RZey'/>
    - $$𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔h𝑡 = 𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑠 × 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑙𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡h$$<span id='bKvO3--DF'/>
    - $$𝑊 = 𝑚𝑔$$<span id='8-KB1wlSx'/>
    - Gravitational **force** enables the various bodies to orbit around others. For example:<span id='-ei2Iwif-'/>
        - Moons orbit planets<span id='p9C8iHppU'/>
            - The orbits of moons are slightly elliptical with near constant orbital speed<span id='DJX9Kj0CZ'/>
        - Planets and comets orbit the Sun<span id='gwB_xkNFH'/>
            - The orbits of planets are **slightly** elliptical with near constant orbital speed.<span id='xilU-LsZN'/>
            - The orbits of comets are **highly** elliptical with a greater orbital speed the closer they are to the Sun.<span id='BViKMCiOJ'/>
        - Artificial satellites orbit the Earth<span id='fNjJU0wNz'/>
    - Orbital Motion<span id='_hjOxo-Rz'/>
        - The greater the orbital radius or the smaller the time period, the greater the orbital speed:<span id='apEmLd_yn'/>
