- Thoughts On Learning<span id='O2vqybAs1'/>
    - **Ideas start hard and finish simple.** Complicated ideas get easier. Why? Well, the idea is the same, our thinking process has improved. Multiplication flummoxed the Romans until a number system came along. I know that math, science, business, or any topic can become intuitive after overcoming the initial complexity.<span id='XmWl2v3nt'/>
    - **The best teacher is you – after you’ve learned the subject.** You, 10 minutes after learning a new idea, are the perfect tutor for your current self. You overcame the difficulties and can explain the solution in language that makes sense. We can’t go back in time, but we __can__ capture Aha! moments as soon as they happen. Some lucky soul can avoid the pothole we just climbed out of.<span id='MLLBNdPz6'/>
    - **Get a map, not directions.** Memorization isn’t understanding: you follow the recipe, apply the formula, and get from A to B without knowing why. Directions “work”, but what about wrong turns? A new destination? Helping a friend who’s lost at point C, not A? This site is about sharing maps, the intuitions that get you from any point to any other point. We’ll leave the raw details for the encyclopedias.<span id='-GoLjiYUz'/>
    - **I still don’t know (and that’s OK with me).** Learning is a constant process of updating what you thought you knew. Gaps aren’t “holes” to be ashamed of, they are leaks in your roof that you can patch up. I love finding mistakes in my thinking: it’s one less misconception.<span id='36RlPu62z'/>
