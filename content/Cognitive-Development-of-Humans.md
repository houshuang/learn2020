- 0 – calculatory - Exact [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) only, no [generalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalization) Human-made programs manipulate 0, 1, not 2 or 3. Minimal human result. [Unorganized machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_machine) (in [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)'s sense) act in a way analogous to this stage.<span id='EQs2cDAim'/>

- 5 – nominal - Find relations among concepts Use names for objects and other utterances as successful commands Single words: ejaculatives & exclamations, verbs, nouns, number names, letter names<span id='7-lW0i5ho'/>
- 6 – sentential - [Imitate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitate) and acquire sequences; follow short sequential acts Generalize match-dependent task actions; chain words Various forms of pronouns: subject (I), object (me), possessive adjective (my), possessive pronoun (mine), and reflexive (myself) for various persons (I, you, he, she, it, we, y'all, they)<span id='2Ya2Htz1x'/>
- 7 – preoperational - Make simple [deductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning); follow lists of sequential acts; tell stories Count [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) roughly events and objects; connect the dots; combine numbers and simple [propositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition) Connectives: as, when, then, why, before; products of simple operations<span id='l7Gw_jyfJ'/>
- 8 – primary - Simple [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) deduction and [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical) rules involving time sequence; simple arithmetic Adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, counts, proves, does series of tasks on own Times, places, counts acts, actors, arithmetic outcome, sequence from calculation<span id='SDxqvLq_k'/>
- 9 – concrete - Carry out full [arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic), form [cliques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique), plan deals Does [long division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_division), short division, follows complex [social rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)), ignores simple social rules, takes and coordinates [perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive)) of other and self Interrelations, social events, what happened among others, reasonable deals, history, geography<span id='S9b0zrYJN'/>
- 10 – abstract - Discriminate [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)) such as [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype); logical [quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification_(logic)); (none, some, all) Form variables out of finite classes; make and quantify propositions Variable time, place, act, actor, state, type; quantifiers (all, none, some); [categorical assertions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_proposition) (e.g., "We all die")<span id='mM93z6b49'/>
- 11 – formal - Argue using empirical or logical [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence); logic is linear, 1-dimensional Solve problems with one unknown using [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra), [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) and [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism) Relationships (for example: [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality)) are formed out of variables; words: linear, logical, one-dimensional, if then, thus, therefore, because; correct [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific) solutions<span id='30yf5KvmE'/>
- 12 – systematic - Construct multivariate [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) and [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) Coordinate more than one variable as input; consider relationships in contexts. [Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenon) and concepts situated in a multivariate context; systems are formed out of relations; systems: [legal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal), [societal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal), [corporate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate), [economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic), [national](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation)<span id='G2wIP8ja2'/>
- 13 – metasystematic - Construct multi-systems and metasystems out of disparate systems Create metasystems out of systems; compare systems and perspectives; name properties of systems: e.g. [homomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic), [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic), [complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic)), consistent (such as tested by [consistency proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_proof)), [commensurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensurability_(philosophy_of_science))Metasystems and supersystems are formed out of systems of relationships, e.g. [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) and promises<span id='-DpntAvNI'/>
- 14 – paradigmatic - Fit metasystems together to form new [paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm); show "incomplete" or "inconsistent" aspects of metasystems Synthesize metasystems Paradigms are formed out of multiple metasystems<span id='VA-1m8VtQ'/>
- 15 – cross-paradigmatic - Fit paradigms together to form new fields Form new fields by crossing paradigms, e.g. [evolutionary biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology) + [developmental biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_biology) = [evolutionary developmental biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_developmental_biology) New fields are formed out of multiple paradigms<span id='Sps2i_wso'/>
- 16 – meta-cross-paradigmatic (performative-recursive) - Reflect on various properties of cross-paradigmatic operations Explicate the dynamics of, and limitations of, cross-paradigmatic thinking The dynamics and limitations of cross-paradigmatic thinking are explained as they are [recursively](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive) enacted<span id='9qymjUMB4'/>
