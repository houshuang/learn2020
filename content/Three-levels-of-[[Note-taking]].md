title: "Three levels of [[Note taking]]"

- My concept of three levels (from **Roam meetup**)
    - curious about note taking and knowledge organizing in social contexts - how to move across/between #[[Note taking]]
        - individually - **Building a Second Brain** (**Tiago Forte**), **Zettelkasten** (Luhmann) etc
            - journaling
            - common place books in the middle ages
            - Bullet Journaling
        - in small groups - **Marlene Scardamalia** and **Knowledge Building**/**Knowledge Forum**, a lot of **Computer Supported Collaborative Learning** in general, focusing on use of **wikis** in classrooms etc. **Group cognition**, **shared epistemic responsability**. "What does the group know?"
            - visualizations, **Knowledge Cartography** - **Issue Based Information System**
        - in networks - **Michael Nielsen**'s **Reinventing Discovery**, **George Siemens** and **Stephen Downes**' **Connectivism** for learning networks etc.
    - But in addition, how does this interact with the design of artefacts
        - what does it mean for learning and teaching? A lot of texts about note taking etc focus on individual students in a traditional system, but how would you redesign the actual education experience around students "building second brains" etc?
            - example of the iversity MOOC on math (I think I have a blog post?)
        - what is the future of the **non-fiction book** etc?
            - re     - Question about communication - compression and expansion/serialization (#narrative), like two amazing AIs who have to communicate through morse signals. Also link between note taking and cognitive structures - what does it mean to have learnt something?

    - This tension between designing for certain interactions, and excluding other/narrowing the space
        - link to **over-scripting** and fading **scaffolding**?
        - also **Distributed cognition** - some things it's OK to always leave outside / **digital prosthesis**
        - **Dan Suthers** and **salience** (**suthers2008empirical**)
