- **Spaced repetition** is an [evidence-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_learning) technique that is usually performed with [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard). Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect).<span id='lvVgP8gRI'/>
