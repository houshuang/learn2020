- Ingredients
    - 200 g wheat
    - 100 g spelt
    - baking soda
    - salt
    - 1 ts salt
    - 30 g oats
    - raisins, currents, pieces of dates (soak in hot water)
    - 0.3 l yoghurt
    - 0. 1 l milk
    - Nuts, almonds, pecans, walnuts (cut in pieces and toast in oven)
- Approach
    - Mix everything well, bake at 200C about 20 minutes
    - I usually take it out and let it bake longer. Today it was a bit not done - maybe should make it thinner and make smaller ones. Anyway delicious.
