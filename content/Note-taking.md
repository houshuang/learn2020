- <a id='QNtd8WmE4'/>(Something about choosing good sources?)
- <a id='iLveamHyX'/>First make it easy to **Capture**.
- <a id='6vDxve3AB'/>**Progressive summarization**. It’s actually good to wait a bit after you’ve read something. Maybe it’s never relevant again - that’s OK. But make sure it’s findable (at least a few keywords etc, as well as the date context, if you remember you read something at a certain time)
- <a id='hEfTK6uCR'/>&#8203;<mark>If you do come back and decide to use it, the time that has gone has helped you see what is truly important. Re-reading it in itself helps with the memory (repetition), and you might see new connections based on other things you’ve read/thought about in the meantime. </mark>
- <a id='KXVhwmD5u'/>At this point, you might add hashtags to specific points, add your own questions or comments etc. **Tiago Forte** recommends highlighting, not sure how useful that is for Roam? I’m also wondering about deleting irrelevant notes - especially for Twitter threads etc?
- <a id='EFv9X8t3h'/>If it’s an important source (ie. if you ever want to specifically remember what that book was about, as opposed to just using some of the ideas), you might do a formal writeup - create a page for the authors/the book, summarize the contents (chapters) etc.
- <a id='GZIjRhIek'/>When there are important ideas, you try to create a **Permanent Notes (concept)**. Declarative name, full sentences etc. This can come from an argument in a book that you summarise, or from an assortment of snippets and your own thoughts that you have captured.
- <a id='DM1gw9grD'/>In the Permanent Note, you can also be more explicit about linking to sources and evidence.
- <a id='UO9wQOcIs'/>You list the Permanent Notes on a TOC page, and tag them so that you can filter. You should also make links between Permanent Notes to create **[[Zettelkasten]]-p**
