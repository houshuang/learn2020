- Neuro-Education means 'educating the brain' - teaching people how they can train their brain to learn more effectively<span id='UpF7xpSd3'/>
- The Neuro-Education system we have created in partnership with [[Smart Start Minds]] a company who have been working in brain training through neurofeedback since 2004.<span id='eh2ar-q0h'/>
- In a nutshell, neurofeedback training relays data from the brain's current activity to the learner, so the learner gets to feel what it's like when they are focused, and the difference between high and low attention states.<span id='nzPvxd8th'/>
- Over a programme of training, attention can be directed more precisely and for longer periods of time. Hence students can work deeper and for longer through Neuro-Education<span id='l9w2Piazp'/>
- We use Learn2020's suite of content for the training programmes and the devices are supplied by [[Smart Start Minds]]<span id='KhHrUVi9K'/>
