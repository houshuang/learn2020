- take a blank sheet of paper<span id='u88ZpJr0o'/>
- capture everything you know about a topic in 5 minutes: components, concepts, diagrams, formulae, key points<span id='jFCmF-G8P'/>
- most useful as a before and after exercise with the ability to compare and contrast the two blank sheets<span id='qQPoKXkA7'/>
- similar to a [[Pre-Test]] and a [[Post-Test]]<span id='41psIFWnH'/>
- one tip when going to lectures is to get to your lecture 5 mins early and do a quick **blank sheet** on what you think you know about the lecture topic<span id='-PwJEpB2_'/>
- This acts as a primer, preparing the ground for the seeds of knowledge that are about to be delivered in the lecture<span id='RkxsHnAr-'/>
- following up with a blank sheet after the lecture, or when you get home is a olympic-level self-discipline<span id='S3oNyb4aE'/>
