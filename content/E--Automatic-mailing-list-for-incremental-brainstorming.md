            - <a id='bcvmi6Co_'/>In the meantime, I've been thinking about something very regular, small granularity, but accretive...
                - <a id='n1JrzIC95'/>Like going into my Instapaper inbox every morning and spending 10 minutes processing one or two articles, adding a few links, maybe making an SRS question...
            - <a id='aladCHMSZ'/>**Some kind of idea of "batting back and forth" on a topic. A bit like postal chess - seeing one move and making one move... **
                - <a id='BRLp_s1B6'/>What does it mean to "make a move" in argumentation/exploration?
                    - <a id='unWtYDciU'/>Like someone asking a question or postulating something (How can we have more meaningful online parties), and the other one making one rhetorical move... Maybe "What do you mean by meaningful" - and back and forth... limited to one question/answer per day?
                - <a id='5eD4zBRkb'/>But then somehow mapped out so it's not just a long iMessage thread...
                - <a id='6IZqiiOGg'/>Is there a way in which it can both provide real insight after a while, but still not get so complex that you need to spend 30 minutes to "load" the entire context, before you can make your move?
            - <a id='e-VsYNAZc'/>I've thought about stuff like a concept map paired with quick voice messages or something... Different ways of mapping, visualizing. A good friend of mine worked a lot with scaffolds when we did collaborative learning - UIs that encourage students to use certain words or phrases like "this cannot explain..."
