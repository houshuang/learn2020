- The Learning Sprint: UFAST<span id='4cxCSbISR'/>
- The Learning Sprint is simply 'how to learn a year's worth of content in 5 days'<span id='SGe5-JG9E'/>
- For rapid bulk acquisition of content, the Learning Sprint is an effective tool<span id='kR7n485J2'/>

- 3 Step Deeper Dive: What/Why/How<span id='PCxp4ASsb'/>
    - What is it?<span id='XJGonLF7D'/>
        - It’s a 5-Day, intensive accelerated learning programme for rapid bulk acquisition of subject knowledge.<span id='QO8-3NYYF'/>
    - Why is it useful?<span id='L5_445spS'/>
        - 1. It delivers a significant boost in subject knowledge, and exam performance in just 5 days.<span id='rBZviEHt1'/>
        - 2. It introduces techniques that can be applied to the mastery of any subject.<span id='mvoUB1gMF'/>
        - 3. It expands student minds by demonstrating their unlimited potential given the right approaches.<span id='gWOfQtzSP'/>
    - How does it work? We take students through the 5-Step UFAST process<span id='UOB_qwbJ9'/>
        - We take students through the following 5 step UFAST process:<span id='L85BjzssK'/>

        - Pre-Sprint Preparation: [[Setting the Stage]]<span id='3pIx1KQIj'/>
            - To ensure a successful Learning Sprint, there are a few things that need to be done in advance.<span id='dXDwuCWG4'/>
        - Step 1: U is for [[UNPACK the UNCERTAINTY]]<span id='72AVvXQXh'/>
            - We do an initial assessment of students’ knowledge [[Pre-Test]] and then unpack the topic areas, deconstruct the learning, gather all the resources, identify experts and map out the learning sprint’s journey through the UFAST process over the course of the week.<span id='At_l4OhPQ'/>
            - Key Outcome: MAP IT<span id='dJ3yHfp4K'/>
        - Step 2: F is for [[FIGURE OUT the FACTS]]<span id='rhJGBGJNq'/>
            - We hard code the most valuable facts into core memory using deep learning strategies. This is the bulk acquisition of facts stage. Definitions, formulae, terminology, equations, symbols. We create the symbolic logic frameworks on which to build our learning. Facts are the vocabulary of understanding.<span id='0IQ2elrtZ'/>
            - This second day is all about RECALL and at the end of the day students have to be able to recall all the core subject information through reproducing a [[subject map]] This forms a solid platform for the rest of the week.<span id='_d2Rwgr-0'/>
            - Key Outcome: RECALL IT<span id='s2_29Ggo2'/>
        - Step 3: A is for [[ASSIMILATE the ANALOGIES]]<span id='nSlORnk-Z'/>
            - We use sophisticated analogy-making techniques and team strategies like Jigsaw Learning to accelerate the assimilation of the concepts, to absorb mentally the abstractions. To go from the Known to the Unknown, to embody the concepts deeply by relating them to existing experiences. We seek to develop an intuition for the topics, to answer the ALIKENESS question: Ok, so what is it LIKE?<span id='YO9hzaUkv'/>
            - The third day is all about UNDERSTANDING. Students must be able to summarise each concept on demand, using self-drawn diagrams to support their explanations. Students need to be able to draw out any [[topic map]] or [[node map]] from memory.<span id='kC9rJQhEd'/>
            - Key Outcome: DRAW IT<span id='j2kmkosuK'/>
        - Step 4: S is for [[SOAK UP the STRATEGIES]]<span id='lvrz2Y-Xm'/>
            - We use approaches like Reverse Learning and the Feynman Technique to spot, study and master the strategies used to solve the concepts when they appear in problem format. To detect, practice and master the procedures. To soak up the best strategies, to master the best ways to approach assessment and exam questions.<span id='S3SzR29ED'/>
            - By the end of this day, students should be able to answer exam questions with confidence on every topic of the subject.<span id='aULhEt9aA'/>
            - Key Outcome: TEACH IT<span id='w5zfZHnyJ'/>
        - Step 5: T is for [[TEST for TRUTH]]<span id='ifXllP_7n'/>
            - We bring it all together and teach students how to deliver the exam performance of the olympic athlete. To demonstrate their competence, to prove learners can apply their understanding in context.<span id='Ffe_s52BN'/>
            - Key Outcome: PUBLISH IT<span id='R77r9r9IH'/>
- The Wrap-up<span id='1MFuUzRwF'/>
    - To evidence the effectiveness of the process we start the week with the [[Pre-Test]] and we finish the week with a [[Post-Test]]. The enhancement in subject performance is clearly illustrated in the difference between the two test results. but more importantly, students have also improved their capacity to learn. They have customised their [[learning vehicles]]<span id='wEphSVYwk'/>
- Further Notes:<span id='GMYFnDvK1'/>
    - Over a succession of sprints in not necessarily related subjects, students increase their [[learning velocity]]<span id='rkeXhq354'/>
- At a meta-level, our learning methodology incorporates the five processes implicit in the neuropsychology of learning, the [[learning journey]]<span id='M3ZBULGr7'/>
    - [[Discernment]] – the ability to notice what you’re doing and how it’s working<span id='ISIjfsVrk'/>
    - [[Attunement]] – the ability to tune in to the approaches that are moving you most quickly in the direction of improved performance<span id='JpKJCP4vE'/>
    - [[Coherence]] – the moment in which it all starts to come together<span id='ibTEuQczf'/>
    - [[Insight]] – noticing how and why the process is working<span id='D6zR9uM1h'/>
    - [[Embodiment]] – living the process and teaching it by example.<span id='Tt2pWznGD'/>
