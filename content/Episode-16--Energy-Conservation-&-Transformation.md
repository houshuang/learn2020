- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='87Q7f_xUX'/>
- Introduction to the topic as stated in the syllabus:<span id='GfLPBPUq8'/>
- T - This topic introduces different forms of energy in both qualitative and quantitative terms. The concept of energy and its conservation provide useful accounting tools that help to understand the behaviour of physical systems.<span id='6HK00Oi08'/>
- H - The concepts of power and efficiency are also studied.<span id='35V12RfRv'/>
- Here’s the roadmap for the unit:<span id='D-kaT6LO2'/>
- T - We’ll talk about energy conversion and conservation<span id='AN-CrLDMx'/>
- H - We’ll cover work and efficiency, potential energy and kinetic energy<span id='__qhzB0_j'/>
- T - And we’ll talk about Power.<span id='eEVW2xHB-'/>
- H - Covering all the basics from GCSE and then add the flourishes you’ll need to nail these concepts at A level.<span id='sAQhzBbzY'/>
- T - Precisely. So let’s get cracking. Let’s start with Energy...<span id='cTpC3MUlB'/>
- **T- Okay so what’s the big idea? What’s ENERGY all about?**<span id='CJPBXI9uW'/>
- H- Well, we’ve just spent the last few episodes talking about the idea of **force**s as a way to solve problems in [[Physics]]. It turns out that there is another way of solving problems, without needing to use the idea of **force**s, and that’s to use the idea of energy instead. It turns out to be a lot easier than using **force**s in many situations.<span id='WgL66yexm'/>
- T- OK, so what IS Energy.<span id='l-lsJqdcw'/>
- H - The best way of thinking about energy is this: Energy is the universe’s accounting system.<span id='Bmvel3PZI'/>
- It’s a currency, like money, but better as an accounting system because the total amount of energy in the universe is constant.<span id='QdFSG4cPy'/>
- T - That’s great. But I know what money does. What does energy DO?<span id='h6rHWtArU'/>
- H - Just as a financial currency is the ability to buy goods, services and experiences, the energy currency is all about doing stuff, making things happen, causing things to change. Changes of shape, position, configuration and characteristics like momentum, **Velocity** etc.<span id='Qf9W3vttq'/>
- T - Can you give an example?<span id='w5PMFDf11'/>
- H - Sure. So, let’s think of a ball at the top of a hill. If the ball is free to move, it will roll down the hill. You can think of it in terms of **force**s, and the **force** of gravity from the earth pulling the ball, OR you can think of the ball ‘having a certain amount of something that we call energy’ that enables it to roll down the hill.<span id='l8QTYlMMr'/>
- T - That’s an interesting idea. So, the ball has a certain amount of energy that causes it to move, if it is at the top of a hill and not prevented from moving by any blockage or fixtures.<span id='faW1eGWNr'/>
- H - Yep, absolutely. And then as the ball rolls down the hill it increases its **Velocity** and this again enables the ball to do stuff, like knock over a bottle at the bottom of the hill, or make a loud noise as it crashes into a lake, or a bag of spoons.<span id='qORuN4SQL'/>
- T - OK, so energy is something that an object possesses that enables it to do something. I get it.<span id='ooqluCowi'/>
- H - It’s an interesting concept that we further break down into two parts. The first aspect is to do with how the object is configured, either in relation to other things, or in relation to its own atoms and the second aspect is to do with how the object is moving.<span id='TCx-Floxi'/>
- T - OK, so that’s a bit weird and will need a bit of explaining:<span id='x7leGNz13'/>
- H -  At the start, the object is at the top of a hill, so it has energy as a result of being in a certain position relative to the earth. But the ball could also have energy as a result of how its atoms are arranged with respect to each other.<span id='T5yNCXph9'/>
- T - Go on.<span id='4X8zRyZhG'/>
- H - Well, imagine the ball was a large ball, like a football. I could press down hard on this football with my fist and change its shape a little. The ball would bend a little around my fist and when I released my fist, the ball would bounce up. So, in this example, the energy that the ball had that enabled it to bounce up would be as a result of a change of the configuration of its own atoms.<span id='Ns5L5m1vo'/>
- T - Great, so one aspect is to do with the way the overall ‘system’ is configured. What’s the other aspect, the one to do with the way the object moves?<span id='MysZ4aoa2'/>
- H - It’s simply this: Moving objects have the ability to do stuff. They can knock things over, they can break things, they can deform other objects and they can also bang into other objects and get those to move as well.<span id='7tKZpIj9l'/>
- T - OK, so this idea of the energy of something as a currency that enables the thing to do something is pretty clear. This currency can either exist through the movement of the object, or through the way the object is configured.<span id='E5YdL7LAP'/>
- H - Now, technically energy is all the same. It’s all the ability to cause something to happen, to do stuff, but we divide these two scenarios to make our calculations easier.<span id='s-j29NpVr'/>
- T - Go on.<span id='em2T2LcHO'/>
- H - Well, we call the energy of configuration POTENTIAL energy and the energy of movement KINETIC energy. Technically, all energy is potential, because it’s the ability to create an effect, but it’s easier for the maths to divide it into ‘energy stored’ and ‘energy on the move’. Potential energy is ‘stored energy’ and kinetic energy is ‘energy as a result of movement’.<span id='ChAxT6F1J'/>
- T - This word potential has the same meaning in general English. For once, [[Physics]] hasn’t messed around with language! Yes. The potential of something in general everyday usage indicates that there is something stored inside the thing. ‘She’s got great potential as a songwriter etc.’<span id='0gPqNgaKx'/>
- H - And kinetic energy is named after the greek word ‘kinesis’ meaning motion. (You might have heard of telekinesis - which is the power to move something by pure thought.)<span id='rSo5OhZ85'/>
- T - OK, so let’s summarise by thinking of the whole object and its environment as a system. So, for example, the ball, hill, earth, etc is a complete system.<span id='LzhlcAuRB'/>
- H - In that case we would say something like this:<span id='vcHZI7KpE'/>
- Energy is a currency that is possessed by a system, as a consequence of how the system is configured and how its parts are moving.<span id='xzzsQ69oI'/>
- H - Absolutely. We can extend this idea further and state that the POTENTIAL energy of a certain configuration of objects is their ability to create an effect when these objects and/or their atoms become ‘free to move’<span id='vozyp7aA9'/>
- T - That makes sense. So, if I stretch a spring, I am giving it potential energy, because when I release the spring, it will move.<span id='uWew3T2UA'/>
- H - Indeed. And there’s many examples of potential energy. We can think of any system which has energy stored in it, or energy locked up in it as having potential energy. The ability to do something.<span id='DOtZ4Eo9N'/>
- T - OK, so stretched elastic bands have elastic potential energy, chemical batteries have chemical potential energy, objects in a gravitational field have gravitational potential energy.<span id='JmnNWDcGr'/>
- H - That’s absolutely correct. There are many different forms of potential energy.<span id='QN8fmlk-8'/>
- T - So, one thing we might want to know is what happens to this energy, once it begins to be used to actually do something, like the ball rolling down a hill? What do we do next with this great insight? How does the stored potential energy turn into kinetic energy of movement?<span id='SZzbLLk-u'/>
- H - Well, the next big thing you need to know about energy is that energy is never created or destroyed, it’s just changed from one form to another.<span id='bP88KOM9b'/>
- T - Is that actually true? Can’t we just make energy out of nothing? Like in the movies?<span id='aBynGqaRd'/>
- H - Well, it seems like we can’t, although some early experiments in the field of nuclear [[Physics]] indicated that we got energy out of nothing. It turns out that the extra energy was accompanied by a decrease in mass of the system, and the decrease in mass was found to be exactly equal to the energy increase divided by the speed of light squared.<span id='yLToXCmqI'/>
- T - Yes, Einstein’s E equals m c squared equation came to the rescue, by pointing out that energy and mass are interchangeable.<span id='IG1ecXvJZ'/>
- H - Indeed, energy and mass are really different forms of the same thing, and Einstein’s most famous equation explains precisely how mass and energy are really different sides of the same coin.<span id='H7ekPYfcL'/>
- T - What do you mean by that?<span id='reDiXMSVI'/>
- H - Well Einstein said that the real quantity that is always conserved in physical interactions is the mass-energy of the system. So, it’s possible for the energy of the system to be a little bit different if some of that energy has turned into mass, or some of the mass of the system has been converted into energy. But the sum of the mass-energy of a system is always the same.<span id='q6jXF1ROf'/>
- T - But, we don’t have to know much about that just yet, do we?<span id='osgJMmTQG'/>
- H - Well, for A Level, we don’t have to get a deep understanding of this equivalence, but we do have to be able to use the equation.<span id='faylH10tg'/>
- T - And by use the equation we mean, you need to be able to stick numbers into the equation and get answers out!<span id='cf9M8rGSp'/>
- H - Precisely. Anyway, let’s get back to the basics about energy. Let’s say the ball starts rolling down the hill - the ball begins to ‘use up’ some of its potential energy. Where does this energy go? Well, let’s look at what is different now about the whole configuration.<span id='qoGPIvD0T'/>
- T - How do you mean, what is different?<span id='jCey8mgEl'/>
- H - Well, before the ball was moving what was going on?<span id='db6bZ6klo'/>
- T - The ball was stationary.<span id='2ogHqZfur'/>
- H - And now the ball is rolling down the hill. So, what’s happened?<span id='U06RRFJK_'/>
- T - The potential energy that was a result of the ball being at the top of the hill is being turned into movement energy of the ball?<span id='WnUUkprSJ'/>
- H - This is basically true, but it's a bit more nuanced than this actually. It’s actually the difference in potential energy between the two configurations that gets converted into kinetic energy.<span id='pAu9Jxm0j'/>
- T - What do you mean by that?<span id='68hma_dty'/>
- H - Well, if a ball drops down a hill from a height of 50 metres to a height of 30 metres, the amount of energy that can be converted into kinetic energy is equal to the difference between the potential energy of the system with the ball at the two different positions.<span id='ZsSKAtFSH'/>
- T - OK. So, let’s summarise what’s going on here as I see it:<span id='Og_WVtk2N'/>
- It’s possible to get a good understanding of what’s going on in [[Physics]] by thinking of ‘characteristics’ a system has as a result of either its configuration, or its movement.<span id='hLNeQdjWN'/>
- The total energy is always conserved, which means that the energy of configuration plus the energy of movement is constant. That about right?<span id='nfAbuiCjQ'/>
- H - Pretty much it, yes. There are of course many intricacies that we will be going into in more detail later on, but that’s the idea. Energy is the universe’s accounting system.<span id='ilzhR8cDv'/>
- T - Right. In the next one we’ll be looking more at how to do problems that involve conservation of energy and the changing of energy from one type into another. In particular we will be spending most of our time looking at changes between kinetic and potential energy due to movement of objects in gravitational fields.<span id='u_nw4CsjF'/>
