title: "Smart Wisdom Feedback"
---

- Take-aways from having been through the Smart Wisdom Online Training Course<span id='-Je5p5y5z'/>
    - Overview<span id='r-bRWMUVG'/>
        - Overall quality was excellent - production values solid and professional<span id='cCNdllti4'/>
        - Pace would work well for international students<span id='b7wp8_x4d'/>
        - Manner was good, engaging and welcoming<span id='YwLEciYRA'/>
        - The emphasis on getting a couple of things nailed - and then letting people know that it’s up to them how they then flex the minor details was useful<span id='We5fv78WY'/>
    - Suggestions relating to content delivery:<span id='ID_V4NAV7'/>
        - Having a range of different people showcase their processes - e.g. Martin, Martin’s daughter - especially if they’re talking through their process and explaining how they do things later<span id='q4rvbrMQj'/>
        - Producing longer video clips that students could skip through at their own pace might be interesting, rather than having lots of short clips<span id='wB9HfTyCS'/>
        - perhaps a 25 min training session where a few demos were done might work<span id='WQ1BXEz9G'/>

          I get the idea of trying to make it short and modular but I did find that it might have been better in slightly longer chunks once the training was up and running
        - Specific demos in different use cases would be good - e.g. the progressive summarisation of content into revision notes<span id='VGmhkBZ9W'/>

          I suspect students would find these very helpful
        - lots of examples of previously created bases that we could talk through<span id='ZNDKc-Wlc'/>
        - Perhaps a complete subject, then a chapter level breakdown and then an individual topic node breakdown<span id='KnOOr3T7n'/>
    - Suggestions relating to the promotion and business side of things, especially  for a joint project marketing SW into the education sector<span id='Uq6QQD2th'/>
        - I reckon this could sell very well into the education sector, especially the secondary age students - focusing on upgrading your learning operating system - as a key part in an accelerated learning toolkit<span id='usLUBIHpJ'/>
        - The real-time component is going to be most valuable for older students, especially those who are preparing to come to the UK to study at university, but younger students will certainly benefit from the revision note taking aspect, and using it as their main ways of taking notes in current lessons<span id='pHFglaRVr'/>
        - I wonder whether a double-page workbook would be a good approach - the LHS is the space for the knowledge base - the RHS is more like a blank grid for copying down mathematical proofs, diagrams, etc.<span id='p88N5Yl3O'/>
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2FDQwK6wi5S5.jpeg?alt=media&token=64890195-b13a-4fd8-b4ad-87135998b93f)<span id='CoY2ngHx6'/>
        - certifications are very important - I think doing a formal end of course assessment, with a culminating test would be very powerful<span id='017H2sBv4'/>
            - this test could easily consist of an extension of the exercises they’d completed in the training<span id='DgpV-Yn-u'/>
            - for example you have a final 5 minute audio recording of a lecture and they have to submit their final knowledge base for ‘approval’ by the certificate awarding body<span id='emxDK_XDP'/>
            - this could be delivered in a single culminating webinar, in real time, with the students all taking part in a 5 minute live lecture (this would be different every time of course)<span id='HwyWVR5Ml'/>
            - Students then send their completed knowledge bases within a deadline to allow for internet issues etc - maybe within 10 minutes of the test completing<span id='pAQ6owyG0'/>
            - For a higher level certificate we could always do a similar process but then get the students to teach the topic back to us using their maps as a guide<span id='y9ma9AF6R'/>
            - Imagine them going on to create a digital portfolio of all their knowledge maps which they then submit as part of any future college or job application<span id='MJQIYRrVH'/>
            - Combined with certification - even though we’d much rather have students focus on the ‘using it as proof of competence’ there’s a huge tendency in Asian countries in particular to want to have a piece of paper that attests to their ability. Credentials, it’s all about legitimising their competence.<span id='BM-z4ExTd'/>
            - In my experience most families think a portfolio of certificates is more impressive than a portfolio of work!<span id='3PI2MQFz8'/>
    - Long term The Community is the Key...<span id='ysywtt_a0'/>
        - Long term I love the idea of having this community of ‘superlearners’ who are all showcasing their best work sharing tips and hacks as they develop the process and improve it iteratively in their respective use cases<span id='sRJZC3dPk'/>
            - We could use the Learn2020 Community - create a group within that community for Smart Wisdom graduates, and ‘train’ these people to become evangelists of the method - needs a bit of thinking about but it could work<span id='sDnqzGTNK'/>
            - The idea of the knowledge base becoming a subject map has a lot of potential, especially with the collaborative aspect of learning we promote in the Learn2020 community.<span id='ItZKGK94_'/>

    - Next Steps<span id='YHHAsz9Q_'/>
        - Create an overall sales process - something like this:<span id='DPuZ4lJnn'/>
            - Initial contact, register interest in training sessions<span id='6Zk4n6qyW'/>
            - Invite to free demo in a live webinar - about 25x mins<span id='2bgVAjLW6'/>
            - Sign-up for heavily discounted student version of the course (to be configured, added to as detailed above) - target price maybe 20/30 USD<span id='CYKjXpySf'/>
            - achieve level 1 certification upon completion of course<span id='oTAcHHjeq'/>
            - guarantee product - 100%, no quibble money back within 30/60/90 days<span id='KzDsRs02m'/>
            - get invite to join SW private community in Learn2020 app<span id='PF-beDdVU'/>
            - purchase workbooks<span id='h98r5SsBL'/>
                - physical through print on demand service<span id='O0_fkAdj2'/>
                - digital to be used on iPads etc.<span id='Kx5WyH6wW'/>
            - invite students to take the next level SW certificate, which might well have the  real-time culminating test<span id='29C8iWUFj'/>
            - invite students to take the Level 3 SW certificate which could be the ‘workplace’ level. They would demonstrate competence in meetings etc.<span id='C6RAR4Q40'/>
        - Get Zubair to promote it to the ZNotes community as part of the accelerated learning toolkit. Run a series of short webinars as above, but focusing on showing people how to get minimally effective right away<span id='cCTe6_8Z9'/>
        - Perhaps create a ZNotes branded SW template. The key is to get them USING it and talking about it all the time.<span id='XN3ejUZ0H'/>
        - The more SW becomes a demonstrably desirable thing, the more demand there will be for people to get certified at using it.<span id='ZvIGhVVMp'/>
    - Next level would be to train people up as SW practitioners. They go through an additional level of training. They apply it in their businesses for 12 months.<span id='KT6lPKouy'/>
    - Then they can apply to be formally certified practitioners.<span id='SL5J6Dd_T'/>
    - The business model for that can look something like this:<span id='a1DSMr5Nn'/>
        - The pay a modest licence fee of maybe 1000 USD per year to use it for business training<span id='ZfYc-yXBf'/>
        - They perhaps pay a more modest fee to use it in education contexts, perhaps only 100 USD<span id='jRIm5qoZN'/>
        - Payment gives them ongoing recognition as license-holders, as publicly verified by their name being listed on the SW website.<span id='5RUBQVUYj'/>
        - All SW printed and digital workbooks can only be purchased through the central website, practitioners receive a cut and SW receives a regular subscription-like revenue every time the books are purchased - people have to buy notebooks anyway, so it makes sense for them to buy SW ones.<span id='6Ug3ZRMCT'/>
        - Making the books look really classy would be the trick<span id='dql1c-yvV'/>
        - Digital ones can be password protected and tied to the licence-holder - not that difficult to do if we wanted to have that level of control...<span id='hWElggyCz'/>
    - Anyway, that should be enough starting points for discussion tomorrow<span id='C-A49viIe'/>
