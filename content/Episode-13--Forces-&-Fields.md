- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='AwSSaTnY4'/>
- Introduction to the topic as stated in the syllabus:<span id='Gp_B3x97n'/>
- T - In this topic, the natures of some different types of **force** are studied, including how **force**s give rise to both translational and rotational equilibrium.<span id='w3EqnteUR'/>
- H- The concept of pressure is introduced. This acts as a starting point for later work on pressure in gases.<span id='ztitFTUx1'/>
- Here’s the roadmap for the unit:<span id='3JN3SWMIj'/>
- T - We’ll talk about what **force**s are, about why they are an important concept, we’ll give a little overview for interested listeners with applications in industry or **Research**.<span id='jm49CaCPE'/>
- H - We’ll cover what students should have learnt from GCSE and life as a starting point and we’ll bring some new things in that we need to define.<span id='0CYL-s0yr'/>
- T - We’ll also cover what students will need to know, understand, be able to do and how you’re going to be tested on this, covering a few misconceptions and typical mistakes to avoid.<span id='R1-8C1T4k'/>
- H - Pretty much what we normally do, right?<span id='WpGWDv9fC'/>
- T - Precisely. So let’s get cracking…<span id='X7JQ9J955'/>
- **T- Okay so what’s the big idea? What did we observe?**<span id='CvFgneI5L'/>
- H- When a Physicist sees balloon stick to a wall or an apple fall down from a tree, they don’t just accept that it happens. As per usual, we want to have a way of understanding of why something is happening. **force**s are how Physicist came to rationalise such behaviours. Fields are a way of understanding **force**s that act without actually touching anything - Physicists call it ‘acting at a distance’.<span id='YqbuIR66o'/>
- T - In this context the word ‘distance’ just means, not touching, i.e. ‘there is some distance between the two objects involved’.<span id='-GWOXSE3t'/>
- T- Didn’t we do that in the last episode? Am I sensing some deja vu here?<span id='YBcMetudp'/>
- H- There is always a bit of overlap between chapters. Whenever you try to reduce something as complex as [[Physics]] into chapters in a book, or sections of a syllabus, you are certain to have some overlap. [[Physics]] itself doesn’t care about A Levels, books, students being tested, and having to achieve certain learning objectives. [[Physics]] just ‘is’ and part of the problem when we study something is how to compartmentalise it, so that it becomes easier to study.<span id='8deXwU9rm'/>
- So, you don’t have to be worrying about any glitches in the matrix right now. We only talked about contact **force**s and gravity in slight detail. Today we’ll be talking about different contact **force**s, and introducing the idea of fields, as well as moving onto the concepts of density and pressure.<span id='XTTNWQsek'/>
- T- Why are **force**s and fields important?<span id='EUArPO-qJ'/>
- H- **force**s are one of the most well known and most commonly used concepts in [[Physics]] because they are the basis for explaining why things move. But I’m sure you already knew that, since you will have studied **force**s at GCSE.<span id='FQ1EMzwKV'/>
- T- Fields are a concept that’s still studied in depth by **Research** Physicists. You’ve heard about the higgs boson right? It was in the news quite a lot. The higgs boson is actually an excitement in the ever permeating higgs field which is how Physicists explain why things have different mass. The higgs boson itself isn’t really that important to be honest, but its tentative discovery in March 2013 indicated that the higgs field existed which was a massive breakthrough for Science.<span id='WfJBcPCuE'/>
- T - So, what are **force**s and Fields? Is there a difference?<span id='LatTK4xQz'/>
- H - First of all, let’s just get a few things straight. ‘**force**’ and ‘Field’ are just words that we use in the English language to help us make sense of our observations and to communicate our observations to one another. In fact, these words are not very precise, even in [[Physics]], and in many ways it is much more helpful to talk of ‘Interactions’ and ‘Mediators’.<span id='-nCinbIsw'/>
- T - go on…<span id='1HAlQEj78'/>
- H - Well, particles exist and have characteristics such as charge and mass. As a result of these characteristics, we observe them to ‘interact’ with each other. These ‘interactions’ actually appear to consist of other particles, that we call mediators, that travel between these particles ‘carrying the **force**’ if you like.<span id='RMcM9dK2s'/>
- T - In simple language it’s a bit like this: two particles with charge interact by throwing photons at each other.<span id='cRVrutbh3'/>
- H - This is the Electromagnetic **force** in action. Imagine two ships, each of which has a cannon.<span id='bdHy0wW85'/>
- T - If they fire cannonballs at each other they will move apart. If they fire ‘virtual’ cannonballs at each other, they will move closer together.<span id='3VyMBNeS8'/>
- H - So, all **force**s in [[Physics]] operate like this, according to our current level of understanding.<span id='UynvCUMa-'/>
- T - Charged particles repel or attract by throwing photons or virtual photons at each other.<span id='i1dGTsb82'/>
- H - Nucleons (protons/neutrons) repel or attract inside the nucleus by throwing ‘gluons’ at each other.<span id='aWgzmmpYu'/>
- T - Particles with mass throw gravitons at each other. And this is as far as the theory has got us. We haven’t been able to detect gravitons yet. Which means although we know that massive particles DO attract each other, because we can measure these effects, we haven’t observed the particles that are carrying the gravitational interaction.<span id='5CB8HCCWI'/>
- H - Absolutely, it’s a problem, but it’s only a problem for people that don’t understand [[Physics]]. As Physicists we aren’t concerned about what we DON’T have yet. We’re only concerned with what we do have, that seems to work. It would be neat if everything lined up perfectly, but the universe isn’t concerned that much with making our understanding of it easier!<span id='zCFETw_nI'/>
- T - Here’s a summary of the 4 **force**s and where [[Physics]] theory currently sits:<span id='yTJMrdtBm'/>
- Gravity, mediated by gravitons - yet to be observed<span id='Z8NRWxnGP'/>
- Electromagnetism, mediated by photons - is responsible for electricity and magnetism<span id='ZBusA5ll7'/>
- Weak Nuclear **force**, mediated by W+, W- and Z bosons - is responsible for radioactive decay<span id='ylg1F4kdU'/>
- Strong Nuclear **force**, mediated by gluons - keeps the protons and neutrons bound tightly in the the nucleus.<span id='hJTjms--0'/>
- And technically, the Electromagnetic and Weak **force**s are considered to be different manifestations of the same **force**, the Electroweak **force**, which ‘simplifies’ things even further!<span id='qfufbCDJm'/>
- H - So, in summary, it’s a bit more complicated than GCSE, as always.<span id='A6fOYC52S'/>
- T - Well, it’s a bit more complicated than A Level too, but we can still use simplifications to help us gain understanding of the results we get when we perform experiments.<span id='J7_dwIcIx'/>
- T- OK, so what can we remember from GCSE?<span id='NlqXuAnIa'/>
- H- You should already be pretty familiar with **force**s as a general concept. In particular you will know that the weight of an object is the product of the mass of the object and the gravitational field strength where the object is.<span id='lrdRxkBdN'/>
- T- So you’re already at least a little bit familiar with fields even if you don’t realise this already.<span id='rGUf712PG'/>
- H- What a happy coincidence. You’ve also probably experienced air resistance and viscous **force**s if you’ve ever been so lucky as to stick your hand out of a moving car and feel a push against you or if you’ve tried to swim and felt how resistant water is to your movements.<span id='KvXz_LqwG'/>
- T - And of course, we know ALL about Newton’s Laws by now.<span id='_iSih34Oo'/>
- H - Precisely.<span id='8X2IWhyPG'/>
- T- What new things do we need to introduce and define?<span id='jLy0kZybT'/>
- H- Okay so you need to know what a field is. Fields are a pretty abstract concept, but simply put, a field is something that has a value at every point in space and in time. It’s a mathematical concept.<span id='mtVTVO-N5'/>
- T - OK, so it’s like the counting numbers start at 1 and go on forever, and we can define any number by its position relative to other numbers?<span id='N-l_MMcnb'/>
- H - A little bit like that, yes, but let’s not worry about the exact characteristics of all fields, we only study simple **force** fields at A level.<span id='0Xad8CqG3'/>
- H- Yeah that saves time. All you need to think about at the moment is uniform fields. Uniform fields have the exact same value at every point in space.<span id='r7a2c4Xq4'/>
- T- That simplifies things a lot. So how does this “value at every point in space thing work” ?<span id='rMEqdYduX'/>
- H- Well this number at a point in the field tells you how much **force** per a certain physical quantity you will feel if you’re in the field.<span id='am-32atCK'/>
- T- We have to give the value per physical quantity because as you’ve seen with gravity, some **force**s depend on how much physical quantity you have. It’s a bit like how the **force** you feel from the earth depends on how much mass you have.<span id='9-pCeBJPP'/>
- H- Precisely. This **force** can depend on other things like how much charge you have if you’re in an electric field too.<span id='Qx47SWVw2'/>
- T- So fields are recorded as a **force** per quantity. Newtons per kilogram or newtons per coulomb for instance. This just tells you how many newtons of **force** you get for every unit kilogram or coulombs you have. We call this value the field strength.<span id='SqPDwo6XO'/>
- H- If you’re thinking about putting a block of something in a field, in order to calculate the **force** on the block you multiply the field strength by the block’s physical quantity whether it be mass or charge or whatever. You can see examples of some equations in the resources section.<span id='bbiTwVi8k'/>
- H- There’s also a subtlety that we haven’t mentioned so far. You remember that **force**s are a vector quantity right? Fields are given as a **force** per quantity. That **force** part tells you that this value has a direction associated with it too. For uniform fields the direction will always be the same anywhere in the field though so it’s not too difficult a thing to have to worry about.<span id='8o-_vWsgD'/>
- T- Let’s think about holding a positively charged plate above a negatively charged plate. In the region between the plates there will be a uniform electric field. We’ll say that the field strength is 1 newton per coulomb but where is the field directed? You know from GCSE that opposite charges attract and like charges repel. If you put a positive charge in the field it would feel a **force** downwards but if you put a negative charge in the field it would feel a **force** upwards.<span id='qQE5uT8p3'/>
- H - The convention is to state the field’s direction as the direction that a positive charge would feel if it were in the field. In this case the field is always directed downwards This isn’t necessarily more correct than saying where a negative charge would go but Physicists decided that’s what we should say so we do. Don’t complain about this in your exams please just jot down the direction as if you were a positive charge, there’s already enough of a mess when it comes to electrical conventions as it is.<span id='rF3xGh6u8'/>
- T- In this topic the main thing you have to look out for in the exams is the direction of the **force** or field. Don’t forget to write this down when the question asks you for the **force** unless they ask only for the magnitude. Also don’t forget that the direction of the **force** acting on a negatively charged particle in an electric field is opposite to that of a positive field.<span id='GUSqtXwQm'/>
- H - Ok, so that’s enough for now. Let’s leave it there and pick it up in the next episode.<span id='077uxf-jN'/>
- T - Great stuff. See you then.<span id='SKmSkmn7M'/>
