- __T - Welcome back everybody, we’re most of the way through the unit now, and we’re just going to summarise what we need to be able to do.__<span id='7tyj5GNzu'/>
- __H - Yep, this whole topic is pretty dry, but getting a deep understanding of it is a really neat way to stand out from the crowd. Most students don’t really get this at all.__<span id='2xZzkUVX9'/>
- **T - So, what else should be able to do in this Unit?**<span id='KFDPVhHWG'/>
- H - We need to be able to use the SI units and their derived units, such as newtons, with complete confidence and to use the awareness of physical quantities to help us work out whether equations make sense or not. The full list of things you need to be able to do is in the resources section.<span id='NhlVKI1go'/>
- T - We need to use sensible approaches to the idea of significant figures.<span id='OMCUqANFB'/>
- H - A quick recap - significant figures are simple the digits than mean something in a number.<span id='tPLJHn8Hr'/>
- The number 721 has three significant figures.<span id='cIKYujKZe'/>
- The number 0.00461 also has three significant figures, the 4, the 6 and the 1<span id='-nV4uMEE0'/>
- The number 145,693 correct to three significant figures is 146,000<span id='U0O7RCmrV'/>
- The number of significant figures in a result should mirror the **precision** of the input data. That is to say, when dividing and multiplying, the number of significant figures must not exceed that of the least precise value.<span id='IibRK4Xos'/>
- Example:<span id='fcSD85U7S'/>
- Find the speed of a car that travels 11.21 meters in 1.23 seconds.<span id='d7CrkrG_l'/>
- 11.21 divided by 1.23 = 9.11382 metres per second.<span id='ItLb8KMAv'/>
- The answer contains 6 significant figures. However, since the value for time (1.23 seconds) is only 3 significant figures, we write the answer as 9.11 metres per second.<span id='Wn4sbbsVe'/>
- The number of significant figures in any answer should reflect the number of significant figures in the given data.<span id='FDAOS3mQa'/>
- **T - OK Great. So, any other new things we need to introduce, that students might not have encountered in GCSE?**<span id='haOU0nDw4'/>
- H - the last really new concept in this Unit is the idea of scalars and vectors.<span id='FSkaz4HpF'/>
- T- Right so, Scalars and vectors, what are they all about? What are they for and what’s the difference between them?<span id='h2Vk257Bt'/>
- H- Actually they’re closely related ideas. Simply put, a scalar is something that only has a magnitude, or size. Simple scalar quantities include mass, temperature, energy, distance and speed. With Scalars you only need to say how big or how much something is and nothing more.<span id='-xpKKQhqf'/>
- For example - you can completely describe the temperature of a jug of water by saying ‘this jug of water is 62 degrees celsius.’ That’ll do it.<span id='qdUJ1DrmA'/>
- T- Then what does that make a vector?<span id='0GUA17QvA'/>
- H- Vectors are like scalars in that they contain a number, but they contain some extra information.<span id='VScBP5-gp'/>
- This can often make them more useful than scalars themselves.<span id='_5UAdoOoK'/>
- T - Yes, vectors have a number meaning size, but in addition to having that magnitude, the big thing is that they also have a direction.<span id='vVgqFWGng'/>
- H - Can you explain what you mean by that?<span id='C-Cq1Q7kS'/>
- T - Sure. Let’s say a bullet is somewhere in this area near the both of us and it is moving at 300 metres per second.<span id='3XDPBTuIL'/>
- H - OK. Go on.<span id='Z8wmQmUji'/>
- T - Well, what else might you want to know about the bullet?<span id='vmP5tZ7az'/>
- H - Maybe how ‘heavy’ it is? So I can tell how much damage it might potentially do to me?<span id='l8Pdy5mwO'/>
- T - Yes, that would be useful. What else?<span id='yeNjd_XOW'/>
- H - Well, maybe whether it’s got explosives in it, so that I could tell if it would be likely to kill me really badly, or just kill me a little bit…<span id='6plPVpZvH'/>
- T - Hah! Nice one. Of course, very useful again. But how much would you care about that if the bullet was heading in my direction and not yours?<span id='3LT1mXpCj'/>
- H - Aha. Yes, of course. Probably the most important thing to know is which direction is the bullet headed. At least, it’s probably worth knowing all that BEFORE we worry about anything else.<span id='tVIkzNUho'/>
- T - Precisely. So, it helps to have more information than just how fast the bullet is moving. It helps to know the direction in which it is moving.<span id='b3AvOcvMF'/>
- H - And herein lies one of the biggest misconceptions in the whole of A Level [[Physics]]. The difference between speed and [[**Velocity**]].<span id='1R-b8mTHj'/>
- Speed is just how fast something is moving: Useful, but not complete.<span id='PlT7oScaA'/>
- [[**Velocity**]] is how fast something is moving in a particular direction.<span id='m9HaciRQD'/>
- There’s a lot to learn about how to use scalars and vectors, but the **Maths** behind them isn’t difficult. What’s difficult is remembering the importance of the distinction.<span id='ynK8D86UQ'/>
- S for Scalar - S for Speed<span id='W7sryCWeF'/>
- V for Vector - V for [[**Velocity**]]<span id='cUps2PU_O'/>
- **T - How might we be tested on this?**<span id='cBru1AYef'/>
- H - Every single problem we do on the A Level course will require the correct understanding and usage of Physical Quantities. It’s not something you can teach effectively as an abstract concept, it has to be embedded in everything we undertake as a physicist.<span id='r89kdZjvX'/>
- T- You have to be really switched on when you get an answer for any question. You need to always be thinking about prefixes and units to make sure everything is how it should be. It’ll only be worth 1 or 2 marks at the end of every question but over a whole paper those marks really add up.<span id='Dnm7h-cMG'/>
- **H - What common misconceptions are there in this topic?**<span id='YY5KnOjrN'/>
- T - There’s tons of misconceptions here.<span id='McZU-nsWH'/>
- H- Well, not tons. Obviously.<span id='stDMwFF54'/>
- T - Exactly! There are MANY misconceptions in this topic but we’ll bring in a couple here:<span id='8g3WIgTpN'/>
- One we often see is when people confuse the m when used as a prefix meaning milli (or one thousandth) with the symbol m when used to represent the metre.<span id='j77AMIIvr'/>
- Also most SI units don’t have a prefix. But the SI unit for mass is not the gram, it’s actually the kilogram. This is the one exception.<span id='BcZN6S-fj'/>
- kg means kilo - gram, which literally means 1000 grams.<span id='WMz6pB7My'/>
- **T - What are the typical mistakes to avoid, pitfalls to look out for?**<span id='MgufxO_VH'/>
- H - OK, here’s a few:<span id='l1I1fjgeV'/>
- You’ve got to always convert your answers into the unit the question is asking for. Read the question thoroughly! You’ll definitely lose marks if you leave your answers in centimetres when you’ve been asked for millimeters for example. A common mistake that people make is that the SI unit for temperature is Kelvin not Celsius! You need to convert all data in the question from degrees Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273(.15).<span id='TLhQcOfd6'/>
- T - If the question doesn’t mention any particular unit it’s always best to use the SI units.<span id='ptTJ9wZLE'/>
- H- That’s true - however the one problem with that is Avogadro’s constant isn’t actually defined in terms of SI units! The mass unit used is grams and not kilograms. You must convert any masses that you put into the mole equation from kilograms into grams (like we did when we were figuring out how many atoms are in the human body) otherwise your answer will be off by a factor of 1000.<span id='C0N5pubw8'/>
- T- If you do make this mistake though, you’d hope that you’d usually be able to spot it and recheck your working. The back of the envelope method of calculation would also help with this, you’re effectively doing the problem two ways so you’re twice as likely to see any errors.<span id='v2-LWZJ2L'/>
- H- So in summary, you need to go away and learn all the SI units and prefixes, there’s no way around it, you just need to look at them for a bit and get familiar.<span id='-qT7nbzWJ'/>
- Don’t worry if you’re struggling to come to terms with remembering the prefixes, as you begin to use them you will get to know them off by heart.<span id='UDgHqrjOd'/>
- T- Okay that’s all we’ve got for now. That’s the end of Unit 1 and please check the resources section for the summaries and the links to some good further materials to help you really nail this section.<span id='lGxqvjSif'/>
- H- Thanks for listening!<span id='EUOnuX5Id'/>
- T- We’ll see you in the next one. Unit 2: **Measurement** Techniques.<span id='5QNf72CRF'/>
