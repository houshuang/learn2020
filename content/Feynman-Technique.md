- The Feynman Technique is a way to retain crucial information and/or knowledge by teaching it using simple terms to another person. The creator of it, [Nobel Prize](https://golden.com/wiki/Nobel_Prize-V3P5)-winning [physicist ](https://golden.com/wiki/Physicist-K44WP)Richard Feynman, explained that if one cannot describe an idea in simple terms, then they do not really understand it.<span id='kA-Mi-9dS'/>
- The ability to use this technique to explain a topic can prove one's understanding of it.<span id='rxsV62En-'/>

- The technique uses four steps to obtain information and gauge the genuine understanding of the individual learning it.<span id='8xugGRmMV'/>
    - Choose a topic or idea that you want to gauge your comprehension on; it can be a topic that is completely new to you or something that you already know. Write down this topic in a notebook or on a piece, followed by everything you know about it and everything you are learning about it.<span id='dnYaRvDy6'/>
    - Write an explanation using simple language about the topic in the notebook as if you were teaching a class on it.<span id='MIH1F0xYU'/>
    - Observe the gaps in your knowledge on the topic and return to studying about those specific gaps.<span id='ewloLOa5I'/>
    - Simplify your explanation in number 2. This can be done using analogies.<span id='oH7w9SZX0'/>
