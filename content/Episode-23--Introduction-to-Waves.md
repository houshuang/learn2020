- Introduction<span id='S4fU_AidD'/>
- T - In this topic, we’ll be having a look at a whole new area of [[Physics]].<span id='o5ZGEd7pg'/>
- H- Yes, so far, we’ve been looking mostly at an area of [[Physics]] called Mechanics, which is broadly to do with how objects move.<span id='RYDPnmNkG'/>
- T - And now we’re going to look at how energy and information moves, without objects themselves moving.<span id='0CMyiZtvr'/>
- H - Now that might seem mysterious, but we observe it all the time; when you listen to the radio, watch TV, connect to a wifi signal, or skim stones across a lake.<span id='u0efbsvU-'/>
- T - Yes, it’s a topic called waves. And the fundamental idea is that waves are a way to transfer energy from one place to another without the net movement of objects. Here’s what it says in the syllabus:<span id='cBCY-iLFd'/>
- H - This topic introduces the basic properties of transverse and longitudinal progressive waves, including the determination of the frequency and speed of sound waves. The electromagnetic spectrum is also introduced.<span id='7rQl5OXJI'/>
- T - These basic properties of waves are developed further into a study of the Doppler effect and of ultrasound for diagnostic purposes.<span id='rNApQGf1Z'/>
- H- The ideas of simple wave behaviour, such as reflection and refraction of light, would be useful prior knowledge.<span id='7Su-5FWp0'/>
- H - That might sound like a load of guff, but don’t panic. There’s actually nothing new to you here. You know about all these things and you have a sense of what they all mean. You just might not be familiar with some of these new words.<span id='Gf_AbF-Cx'/>
- T - Here’s the roadmap for the unit:<span id='inQOJZJtx'/>
- We’ll first have a look at what waves are, how you make them, and how you describe them using words.<span id='yXfAe8Fo3'/>
- H - Then we’ll get into some ways to visualise waves, using drawings and graphs.<span id='0_SP1-e2P'/>
- T - We’ll then bring in some ways of doing calculations, using something neat called the wave equation.<span id='r3rnWYK8V'/>
- H - We’ll have a look at the [[Physics]] behind what we notice when a police car zips past us with its sirens blasting. The siren note changes due to something we call the Doppler effect.<span id='ZFNXWNKB6'/>
- T - And finally we’ll have a look at something called the electromagnetic spectrum which is responsible for wifi, heating food through microwaves, mobile phones, light and X-rays.<span id='xsvVrt2Yy'/>
- **T- Okay so what’s the big idea? What did we observe?**<span id='QHQI8uLf-'/>
- H - Well, up to now we’ve been mostly concerned with objects, and the interactions between objects and the movement of objects. It turns out that there’s more to [[Physics]] than objects.<span id='fd5-Y85am'/>
- T - I figured there was going to be more. There’s always more.<span id='5_Uo3mxUF'/>
- H - Yep, and most of everything from now in is actually pretty difficult to observe directly. For example, you know that there exists something that we call ‘wind’ not because we can actually see the wind, but because we can observe the ‘effects of the wind’.<span id='IFMDdl16d'/>
- T - Yeah, right, we observe that the leaves of a tree are moving and we can’t see any reason for why they are moving, so we come up with the idea of the movement being caused by some invisible **force**. We give that invisible **force** a name so that we can talk about it efficiently with people.<span id='kLDc7muxS'/>
- H - Right and then we try to analyse it a bit more closely and say that wind is actually the movement of some very small objects called ‘air molecules’ that happen to be moving incredibly fast, so that even though they’re too small to be seen by the human naked eye, they end up hitting the leaves with such terrific velocities that their momentum is enough to cause the leaves to move.<span id='HioBeRocE'/>
- T - Yes. And then we follow this line of reasoning to end up with a theory of molecules, molecular movement etc. And we test it and it seems to work.<span id='82wOqPmwo'/>
- H - OK, that’s right. So, [[Physics]] is pretty neat because we can observe things, come up with theories to explain our observations and then test these ideas. And if our ideas generate predictions that then end up being borne out by subsequent experiments, we have something useful as a working theory.<span id='4bwnTzShi'/>
- T - So, how does that all fit in with the concept of waves?<span id='CbfwzrHHK'/>
- H - Well a wave is a way to move energy from one place to another, without objects themselves needing to move. Well, it’s not quite as simple as that, but let me explain using the waves you might have experienced when at the beach, or in any kind of swimming pool or lake.<span id='v0WqnNJHS'/>
- T - OK, So, when you drop a stone onto the surface of a lake, you notice that circular ripples spread out in all directions away from the point of contact between the stone and the lake’s surface.<span id='SBtOyxXn_'/>
- H - So, someone at the other side of the lake could tell you’ve dropped a stone into the lake because they can see the ripples.<span id='1SKY2fqEI'/>
- T - Does the water itself move?<span id='4X5i9Y1KZ'/>
- H - Well, here we have to be very careful. The water definitely moves. The ripples can be thought of as ‘lumps’ in the water that move out in all directions. But has the water moved from one place to another?<span id='RZps82q2z'/>
- T - Well, what do you mean exactly?<span id='RUQd59d1q'/>
- H - Well, when I throw a football to you and you catch it, the football changes place. It used to be in my hand and now it is in your hand. That’s because it’s an object. The whole of the object moves from one place to another.<span id='sUQCBC6Fh'/>
- T - And in the case of the stone dropped into a lake, the water doesn’t change place. A ripple in the water, a lump, a disturbance moves from where the stone hit the water out in all directions.<span id='rrQdd3Apm'/>
- H - So, we have movement for sure, but it’s just the bump, the ripple that changes place, not the water itself.<span id='RRcArvmoI'/>
- T - And this is the whole idea of waves. A wave is just a movement of energy or information from one place to another, without the movement of objects.<span id='MXIDyCpWH'/>
- H - one definition of a wave is this: A wave is a propagation of energy.<span id='_3Hp07khU'/>
- T - And that word ‘propagation’ is a bit of a tricky one and you can mostly just replace it with the words: ‘sending out’<span id='SFC0qCZNI'/>
- H - Yep. A wave is a sending out of Energy. I’m going to include information here. Technically information is a more general description, as information includes energy. We don’t need to agonise too much over this. A wave is just a way of carrying energy, a way of sending energy or information from one place to another.<span id='8wUXBGD6U'/>
- T - And there are many places in English where you will have encountered these words and for once, they are mostly used correctly.<span id='YTLArX1uI'/>
- H - Yes, water waves, sound waves, light waves are all phrases that you might hear in sentences in everyday English.<span id='W1eytdRlH'/>
- T - The big idea is simply that a wave is a way that energy can be carried from one place to another and we’re going to have a look in more detail about how this carrying of energy actually works now.<span id='zkLTj-nEW'/>
- H - The first question you might want to ask is what makes a wave?<span id='__PU8mVoi'/>
- T - OK. What makes a wave?<span id='3H5VzwLe8'/>
- H - I’m glad you asked. It’s a wiggle.<span id='0OeSwIZV7'/>
- T - A wiggle makes a wave. Right…<span id='Pp9t_3C3R'/>
- H - We would often use fancy language and call it a vibration, or an oscillation. But that’s all it is. A wiggle up and down, or side to side, or backwards or forwards.<span id='Z3SBDHshm'/>
- T - Yes, and the energy that was in this initial wiggle is then carried by a medium, like air or water from where the wiggle started in all directions possible.<span id='3m_3OJxOm'/>
- H - So, when I drop a stone on a lake, I cause the surface at the point of impact to wiggle up and down and side to side. This energy then spreads out in all directions. The energy gets gradually weaker and weaker because it is being spread thinly in all directions.<span id='KSiNvdLg5'/>
- T - As you know we can’t create or destroy energy. So, if the energy spreads out in all directions, it must create a weaker and weaker effect. So, once a ripple has spread out 100 metres into all directions, the energy in the ripple is perhaps barely noticeable to the human observer. Instead of causing perhaps several trillion molecules to each move a few centimetres up and down, the energy might now be causing many trillions of water molecules to each move up and down by a few micrometers.<span id='CuVCB46bi'/>
- H - So, any time you hear someone speak, it’s worth realising that the energy in the sound wave is not just coming towards you, it’s spreading out in all directions, however it can. This explains why you can’t hear people over large distances. It’s not because they’re too far away from you at all. It’s because the energy is going in all directions and only a tiny percentage of it is going to be directed towards you.<span id='OkeBaWKuF'/>
- T - So, on with some more stuff on waves.<span id='Q1ixz7PTl'/>
- H - There’s basically two main types of waves: Waves that move in all directions and just keep going, and waves that somehow get trapped.<span id='_3ZX3UIG5'/>
- T - The ones that continue to go on for ever are called progressive waves, because they make progress! Well, that might help you remember them…<span id='7JZKcI-aV'/>
- H - The waves that are trapped are called standing waves and the most common example of the standing wave is when you shake a rope between two people, one person holding their end still and the other moving their end up and down.<span id='2TlW6tZzC'/>
- T - This wave is called a standing wave because it gets trapped between the two ends of the rope. Other examples of standing waves are in musical instruments, when you play the guitar, the saxophone, the violin and the organ. Music is only possible because of this ability to trap standing waves in tubes or on strings. That’s basically the history of musical instruments in a sentence.<span id='tdWATXpN1'/>
- H - More on that in another episode.<span id='G8jqr6PPV'/>
- T - Music also has progressive waves as well of course. Because the sound is created in the instrument thanks to standing waves, but we actually hear the wave when they move away from the instrument, through the air and progress eventually into our ears.<span id='DIpgYMlNq'/>
- H - So, progressive waves are when the waves then shoot off in all directions, doing their thing, taking their energy with them.<span id='ImlTEwObt'/>
- T - OK, well we’re going to have a look at Progressive Waves first. And there’s two types of progressive waves.<span id='bXhiuAzHV'/>
- H - Transverse waves are when the wiggles are at right-angles to the direction the wave is moving in. So, a ripple in a lake is a transverse wave. The surface of the water is moving up and down and the wave is moving from one side of the lake to the other. Trans means across, and you can remember this by thinking of transatlantic travel, which is travel across the atlantic. The direction the vibrations go in is across the direction of the wave, at 90 degrees.<span id='Tp84_-dnv'/>
- T - Other examples of transverse waves are light waves, radio waves, microwaves and heat waves. Although the transverse behaviour is not possible to observe in these ‘electromagnetic waves’.<span id='NphRGtdgZ'/>
- H - And the other type of progressive wave is called a longitudinal wave and this is when the direction of the vibration is ALONG the direction of the travel of the wave. Examples of this wave are sound waves and waves moving along a spring under tension.<span id='Q99cM-vFr'/>
- T - OK, so that’s a brief introduction to Waves. We’ve hopefully given you a feel for what they are and the two main types of wave that you will encounter in A Level [[Physics]].<span id='gsa4p-e5x'/>
- H - In the next episode we’ll be having a look at how to talk about waves. We’ll learn a language for describing waves and then we’ll have a look at the wave equation. This is simply a way to relate these basic characteristics of a wave to things we can actually observe.<span id='knAMKdhKR'/>
