- Overview to Day 2: FIGURE OUT the FACTS<span id='3GPxaEfpc'/>
    - __Facts are the vocabulary of understanding__ - Tom Cassidy<span id='hze8GEtV7'/>
    - Key Objectives<span id='B0MO-v2ID'/>
        - 1. Map the Subject<span id='5aZ7gji3v'/>
            - To have created a first draft [[subject map]] for the subject of the sprint.<span id='wm90_GA-A'/>
        - 2. RECALL IT!<span id='TxehYaVLa'/>
            - To be able to draw out the [[subject map]] from memory using the [[blank sheet]] technique<span id='MbQdrxRcG'/>
            - Use [[Spaced Repetition]] software such as [[Anki]] to internalise the vocabulary of the subject into memories (instant access [[RAM]])<span id='lKa4RfRhK'/>
    - Introduction<span id='H_Vq3fYww'/>
        - We hard code the most valuable facts into core memory using deep learning strategies. This is the bulk acquisition of facts stage. Definitions, formulae, terminology, equations, symbols. We create the symbolic logic frameworks on which to build our learning. Facts are the vocabulary of understanding.<span id='uf8VN7UWk'/>
        - This second day is all about recall and at the end of the day students have to be able to recall all the core subject information. This forms a solid platform for the rest of the week.<span id='Nvi57rDTj'/>

        - 'The importance of memory' or 'I now believe memory of the basics is often the single largest barrier to understanding.' by Michael Nielsen, research fellow at Y Combinator Research https://ycr.org/<span id='fvq-H-YRR'/>
            - How important is long-term memory, anyway?<span id='bqPFUEv1S'/>
                - source: http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html<span id='eTQ2uHGHJ'/>
                - Long-term memory is sometimes disparaged. It's common for people to denigrate “rote memory”, especially in the classroom. I've heard from many people that they dropped some class – organic chemistry is common – because it was “just a bunch of facts, and I wanted something involving more understanding”.<span id='h6Tgkike0'/>
                - I won't defend bad classroom teaching, or the way organic chemistry is often taught. But it's a mistake to underestimate the importance of memory. I used to believe such tropes about the low importance of memory. But I now believe memory is at the foundation of our cognition.<span id='sRoZn0gF-'/>
                - There are two main reasons for this change, one a personal experience, the other based on evidence from cognitive science.<span id='aCsM2bh-c'/>
                - Let me begin with the personal experience.<span id='bB0oWRMLD'/>
                - Over the years, I've often helped people learn technical subjects such as quantum mechanics. Over time you come to see patterns in how people get stuck. One common pattern is that people think they're getting stuck on esoteric, complex issues. But when you dig down it turns out they're having a hard time with basic notation and terminology. It's difficult to understand quantum mechanics when you're unclear about every third word or piece of notation! Every sentence is a struggle.<span id='tyn3KQN07'/>
                - It's like they're trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in French, but only know 200 words of French. They're frustrated, and think the trouble is the difficulty of finding a good theme, striking sentiments and images, and so on. But really the issue is that they have only 200 words with which to compose.<span id='u-AbyRZ-J'/>
                - My somewhat pious belief was that if people focused more on remembering the basics, and worried less about the “difficult” high-level issues, they'd find the high-level issues took care of themselves.<span id='TSLrC-oyF'/>
                - But while I held this as a strong conviction about other people, I never realized it also applied to me. And I had no idea at all how strongly it applied to me. Using [[Anki]] to read papers in new fields disabused me of this illusion. I found it almost unsettling how much easier [[Anki]] made learning such subjects. I now believe memory of the basics is often the single largest barrier to understanding.<span id='e1a_2Om-4'/>
                - More on [[Spaced Repetition]] as a memory enhancing technique<span id='i7oD5fRjg'/>
- Timetable to Day 2<span id='UMXTk1Ski'/>
- 1000 - 1130<span id='qyld_ZGDJ'/>
    - 1. Whole Subject Level: Creating a high-level concept map of how the whole subject fits together. This is called a [[subject map]]<span id='hgAi163Yd'/>
        - Starts off with a [[blank sheet]] exercise of everything they can remember from Day 1, or from any previous exposure to the concepts in the subject of [[The Learning Sprint]]<span id='rdgT2e3no'/>
        - The [[blank sheet]] uses the [[SmartWisdom]] template which provides a useful hierarchical structure and logic<span id='-w3YdIrvX'/>
        - Students use the [[Teach to Six]] framework to create a high level view of the subject. The [[subject map]]<span id='G39_fy-CO'/>
            - ((rAVjU--t1))<span id='XwOR4oHv3'/>
            - [[Teach to Six]] is the key framework for students to communicate their learning and a valuable technique from the [[Talk for Learning]] philosophy.<span id='kiK5l7T9I'/>
            - Teach to Six is a structure that makes it really easy to see how well you understand a topic/concept/idea.<span id='QeptJ5ULM'/>
            - The idea comes from the quote (possibly wrongly) attributed to Einstein<span id='p-Wca6Tru'/>
                - __If you can't explain it to a six year old then you don't understand it properly yourself__<span id='00wYJK10t'/>
            - SIX acts as a useful mnemonic for the process.<span id='IIXKc6BJl'/>
            - **S - Simple Language.**<span id='AaFwgJ4q2'/>
                - Students are forbidden from using any words in their explanations that would be outside the vocabulary of a typical six year old.<span id='o_CuBqNn6'/>
                - This reinforces Feynman’s and Einstein’s approaches and avoids students masking their lack of deep understanding of a topic by using technical language.<span id='S1U-7iHlC'/>
                - A key question to ask is this:<span id='xZSjRRVrS'/>
                - Does the introduction of this word add any understanding? Or is it just a definition?<span id='AsduuWEUl'/>
            - **I - It's a bit like...**<span id='v06U1-Spj'/>
                - This is the concept of Analogy. It's far better to say what things are like than to introduce them 'in vacuo'. This is what all learners do anyway whenever you are introducing them to a new concept.<span id='qEmgWbV3d'/>
                - The mind is constantly trying to make sense of the new information in relation to all the information it currently has.<span id='x77pQcEvd'/>
                - A deliberate use of analogy can ease this transition, especially if many different analogies are used.<span id='y9WJoAsMp'/>
            - **X - eXamples**<span id='y3dmzTyqB'/>
                - It's a bit of a fudge, but examples are so important.<span id='CbG03Nflx'/>
                - Newton famously said 'Examples are of more use than precepts when learning the sciences.'<span id='WZZAxDhUR'/>
                - It's critical to remind the explainer that examples are key to embed this learning into the learner's set of well-understood concepts.<span id='9yqegh2BO'/>
                - So, the Teach to Six Framework provides a systematic way of making sure all students become expert explainers.<span id='AqRte4Es3'/>
- 1130 - 1300<span id='a1-MYVD2T'/>
    - 2. Students start building their personal [[Spaced Repetition]] system using [[Anki]]<span id='WJ79jBr7S'/>
        - This uses the core content pre-selected by the [[Subject Expert]]<span id='Z3k2VbXyf'/>
        - Terms<span id='DiVvF4s_i'/>
        - Symbols<span id='dQt8PUL2O'/>
        - Context<span id='Efjr9baJo'/>
        - History<span id='_AY0bx6Q6'/>
        - Definitions<span id='Pmkn_MwBn'/>

    - **Lunch**<span id='tD3QwDUiC'/>
- 1400 - 1600<span id='-cAaMHtZX'/>
    - 3. Students continue building their personal [[Spaced Repetition]] system using [[Anki]]<span id='gnZ5b8nDJ'/>
- 1600 - 1700<span id='jdXrDsry4'/>
    - 4. Students wrap-up their fact-finding with a summary of their learning in the form of the [[subject map]] which they produce live from memory<span id='MAIb0u19Q'/>
