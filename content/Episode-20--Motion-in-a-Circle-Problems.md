- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='IwN_A_etj'/>
- T - Welcome back everybody. In the last episode we talked about the origins of the idea of circular motion and we defined the equation for all objects traveling in a circle, however their motion was caused.<span id='EEe8jAaxt'/>
- H - Yes, we introduced the equation of motion for anything moving in a circle as F = m v squared over r<span id='HBKpTs-U2'/>
- T - In this episode we’re going to talk a little more about how to do problems involving circular motion and hopefully get you to see how they are really not so difficult.<span id='KV6VWZsna'/>
- H - And so let’s just list what we’re going to get through:<span id='KCUSYC57X'/>
- T - We’ll introduce the concepts of the __radian__ and __angular **Velocity**__ and we’ll show you how the linear **Velocity** and the angular **Velocity** are related.<span id='-1UaGg6vC'/>
- H - And then we’ll give you some different scenarios in which circular motion will be important.<span id='2pbCO7_Bj'/>
- T - You’ll need to remember newton’s second law, **F = ma** and you’ll need to be able to do simple **force** sums where you work out the **force**s pointing towards the centre of the circle and relate these **force**s to the F = m v squared over r equation for circular motion.<span id='HHr2yXler'/>
- H - OK, so let’s get cracking. First, we have to introduce the idea of angular **Velocity**.<span id='PNvjvBXwS'/>
- T - So, let's go right back to basics.<span id='spfpswD1Q'/>
- An angle is an ‘amount of turn’.<span id='hkDWtT0rr'/>
- We use numbers to track how big this amount of turn is<span id='_vrOM15EE'/>
- It’s important to talk about which numbers are most helpful when doing [[Physics]].<span id='Bl9vUxNO9'/>
- H - In fact, the most common amount of turn numbers we use come from the 4 directions we use to navigate.<span id='LJeAK__5f'/>
- T - Yes, we use North, East, South and West to describe angles in a very approximate manner. And from this, we get the idea of a quarter-turn between each ‘direction’<span id='ktJM6GOmi'/>
- H - Yes, if you are initially pointing ‘North’ and make a quarter turn clockwise, you will now be pointing East, a further quarter turn and you’re pointing South etc. Simple stuff really.<span id='DkerF2kU-'/>
- T - So, we can use, a quarter, a half, three-quarters and full to describe the amount of turn around a circle.<span id='NDaWMoucD'/>
- H - However, that has limited usefulness and certainly it isn’t very precise.<span id='ZZrEaAXwy'/>
- T - Indeed. Even in navigation this lack of precision lead people to create additional points in direction, South-East, North-West and so on.<span id='_fjcMuZPp'/>
- H - And to get further precision the 1 full turn around the circle was divided into 360 parts, called degrees, which enabled us to usefully send ships to exactly the right point on the globe etc.<span id='yqzqPhoA2'/>
- T - They could have chosen 10 numbers, or 20, or even 100, but 360 seemed sensible, since it related to the 24 hours of the day. (again quite arbitrary of course - we could have had a 10 hour day, with each ‘hour’ being 144 minutes…)<span id='IwySkYOU6'/>
- H - In military settings they use the 12 numbers on the face of the clock to give a little more precision.<span id='YQ39hH2va'/>
- T - Degrees will no doubt will be what most people are familiar with at this level, but it turns out that 360 is a rather large number and not that helpful for physicists.<span id='VTQMz7CH2'/>
- H - OK, so let’s talk about circles for a second and what we know about them.<span id='Hz6fvK9V7'/>
- T - We OBSERVE that the circumference of a circle is always the same number of times bigger than its radius. It’s a little more than three times bigger, for every circle, whatever its size.<span id='eNbNm4KET'/>
- H - We know you know this already. This number is so special, we gave it its own name, **pi** and it’s about 3.14159265 etc…..<span id='Cm9L0HcyB'/>
- T - At this point I would normally recite pi to 200 digits just to show off, but sadly that feat is decidedly less impressive in a podcast than in person!!!<span id='ELcbZW-Lf'/>
- H - And I only learnt it to 40 decimal places, which is precise enough to calculate the circumference of a circle the size of the universe with an error approximately the size of a hydrogen atom. So, those extra 160 digits are just vanity!<span id='t_wsBcYuO'/>
- T - Moving on….<span id='KTg3377Cm'/>
- Let’s think of the circumference of a circle then in terms of its radius. We all know that this is given by 2 times pi times r, usually said ‘2 pi r’<span id='vkxjgW3b7'/>
- And let’s think of the angle you would move through if you travelled around the whole circle, which we could say was 1 complete turn, or 12 hours, or 360 degrees.<span id='qyk_fDUVS'/>
- H - Well, physicists are pretty lazy and we are always looking for shortcuts. So here’s what they did. They hypothesised:<span id='s8Wnb2o_l'/>
- What if we INVENTED a new number to measure turn, that somehow linked the fact that the circumference and the radius were related by this special ratio, pi.<span id='Nm9AS2xqf'/>
- T - Go on.<span id='coEKNFGSW'/>
- H - What if we invent a number that splits a ‘complete turn’ into parts, in the same way that the circumference is split into parts? Like 2 pi parts, each equal in length to a radius.<span id='MqyNs6O6F'/>
- T - Um, still not with you totally yet.<span id='Ge54bSILK'/>
- H - No worries, you’ll see where I’m going in a sec.<span id='WMEDA8p3s'/>
- Let’s create an amount of turn, and call it a special name, a radian, which fits into 360 degrees the same way the radius fits into the circumference.<span id='EE5djHjnZ'/>
- T - So, this would be an amount ot turn that would fit exactly 2 pi times into a full turn?<span id='DrS_s1pyF'/>
- H - Yes it would. It’s an amount of turn that if you multiply it by 2 pi it would take you back to where you started. In degrees, if you multiplied it by 2 pi it would give you 360 degrees.<span id='EMHe36P9Y'/>
- T - Right. I get it. But how might that help?<span id='SBcvjOLsJ'/>
- H - Well, that would just end up making calculations a whole lot easier.<span id='A2sj32tvp'/>
- T - This new number, which in degrees would be equal to 360 divided by 2 pi, or about 57.3 degrees ends up making it pretty easy to do the sums.<span id='-8kX469hO'/>
- H - First of all, we can easily link the distance travelled around the arc of the circle with the angle turned through.<span id='HklRXFLrS'/>
- T - OK, so by definition, you travel 2 pi r in length around the circle when you travel through 2 pi radians in angle. (One full journey around the circle.) That means that if you are measuring in radians, you can multiply the angle by the radius and you get the distance travelled around the circle.<span id='FYBmBOPjz'/>
- This is because 2 pi r is just equal to the angle in radians, which is 2 pi, times the radius of the circle, r.<span id='r6R1qhOfn'/>
- H - That’s a really neat relationship. Whatever angle you’ve turned through, you just multiply the angle by the radius and you get the distance travelled along the arc of the circle.<span id='oKt7i7lsu'/>
- T - In formal language: **d (arc length) = r****θ** for any r and any θ<span id='u3LZ4a8U4'/>
- H - So, how does this help us with the general motion in a circle?<span id='wClufbaFb'/>
- T - Well, distance travelled is a big part of the motion! The other part is how long it took.<span id='d5ifjFLbp'/>
- H - So, remembering that the speed of the object around the circle is given by the distance travelled around the circle divided by the time taken, we can say that the speed = distance over time or rθ over t.<span id='69SElwgO6'/>
- T - We now introduce the idea of the angular **Velocity** as __the rate at which the angle is changing__, i.e. θ over t, and we tend to use the symbol omega, ω. So we say the linear speed around a circle, i.e. linear distance over time, is given by radius times omega, where omega is the angular **Velocity** and is expressed in terms of radians per second.<span id='6Xke9KEy9'/>
- H - In formula terms it’s stated as v equals omega r ( v = ωr ) [This is exactly equivalent to v = rθ over t]<span id='OlBdatxre'/>
- T - And we can then refer to the general equation of circular motion F = m v squared over r, and replace v squared with omega r squared and rewrite the equation as F = m omega squared r.<span id='bRYNAJ_yy'/>
- H - You will be expected to use both forms of the circular motion equation interchangeably. And even though you can always just learn one and then convert between omega and **Velocity** by using the equation v equals omega r, it is helpful to remember both. It may save some time in the exam.<span id='CpUiuf89S'/>
- T - So, we now know that there is a relationship between angular **Velocity** and linear **Velocity**, and we can deduce by comparison with F = ma, that the **Acceleration** of an object undergoing circular motion is given by v squared over r and also by omega squared r.<span id='jEjL6biCi'/>
- H - Precisely, so let’s have a look at how we might use this in a problem.<span id='C7O1OAzGq'/>
- OK, so here’s a problem:<span id='5eI-dezA6'/>
- Let’s see if we can use the [[Physics]] we’ve learnt to estimate the linear speed of someone standing at the equator.<span id='F6UkotyVf'/>
- H - The earth spins around and returns to its same orientation in a period of approximately 24 hours. This means the person sweeps through an angle of 360 degrees, or 2 pi radians in 24 times 60 times 60 seconds.<span id='XZGAiq1OM'/>
- We call the time to travel once around the circle, the PERIOD, of the motion. It’s usually denoted by a capital T.<span id='UkMsddiNA'/>
- So, T = 24 hours or 86400 seconds. This means that the angular **Velocity**, which as we discovered earlier is given by the angle divided by the time taken, can be worked out.<span id='v1GfIQMAF'/>
- Angle = 2 pi radians, t = 86,400 seconds, and so the angular **Velocity**, omega is given by 2 pi divided by 86400 which is equal to approximately 7 times 10 to the minus 5 radians per second.<span id='kzy5Jifs-'/>
- T - So, if the linear speed and the angular speed are related by the formula v equals omega r and the r in this case is the radius of the earth, all we need to do is pop in the value for the radius of the earth and work out how fast we are moving as the earth rotates.<span id='-7eoFvhLt'/>
- The radius of the earth at the equator is around 6.4 times 10 to the 6 metres, and so this gives a linear speed of around 465 metres per second. Pretty damn fast.<span id='1xeE215Lo'/>
- H - Alternatively, we could always just use the radius to work out the circumference and then divide that by the time. Let’s see what that would give us.<span id='9VwoMdfTC'/>
- T - The circumference of the circle is given by 2 times pi x radius  and the radius of the earth is approximately 40000 km. The time taken is still 86,400 seconds, which then gives us a linear speed of 40,000 km divided by 86,400 seconds or .465 km per second, or 465 m per second.<span id='HqC0dTFF8'/>
- H - Unsurprisingly, it’s the same answer, since the relationship we used was exactly the same.<span id='vKFUgUlK6'/>
- OK, next up - how fast does the earth move around the sun? As in, what is the earth’s linear speed in orbit around the sun?<span id='l2r20qt-J'/>
- T - First of all, how FAR is the earth from the sun? Well, it’s about 150 million kilometres, and how long does it take to move around the sun? Well, that one’s easy, right - by definition it takes about a year to travel all the way around.<span id='zdP1zVPR6'/>
- So, the angular **Velocity**, omega, is 2 pi divided by time taken, which is 1 year, or 31,536,000 seconds.<span id='duSDe06Qj'/>
- This gives a value for omega as 2 times 10 to the minus 7 radians per second.<span id='UV2kGgEXo'/>
- H - So, using v = omega times r w gives a linear speed of the Earth in orbit around the sun of around 30,000 metres per second. That makes the earth’s rotational speed look pretty lame in comparison!<span id='eLm35ErEb'/>
- T - OK, let’s do something a little harder that now links the idea of the angular speed with the **force** required to keep something moving in a circle.<span id='soidEX1fQ'/>
- H - Yep. Let’s consider someone whizzing a string with a conker on it and see if we can work out how much tension there will be in the string.<span id='vK7iFNacX'/>
- T - What do we need to know? Well, the MASS of the conker will be important, the LENGTH of the string will also matter and how much TIME it takes to spin around will also be important.<span id='AHEF_ZtWy'/>
- H - Yep, so let’s think of the equation we learnt earlier. The **force** directed towards the centre, which is provided by the tension in the string in this case, is given by F equals m omega squared r. (or m v squared over r)<span id='jf_hBYQyL'/>
- T - So, let’s estimate the mass of a conker as 0.1 kg, the length of the string as 1 metre and the time for 10 rotations of the conker to be 4 seconds.<span id='9DKd1c_K7'/>
- Time for one revolution is then going to be 0.4 seconds. Omega will be 2 pi divided by this time and comes out at around 15.7 radians per second.<span id='JWj1QrLfq'/>
- H - So, m times omega squared times r is 0.1 kg times (15.7 radians per second) squared, times 1 metre, which is equal to about 25 newtons.<span id='oiPsLa4R6'/>
- T - To give you an idea, that’s a **force** roughly equal to the weight of 3 bags of sugar. This is the **force** that is REQUIRED in order for the conker to rotate in a circle. IF the string provides LESS than this **force**, then the conker won’t be able to rotate in a circle.<span id='RP7CMXWKH'/>
- H - So, in summary, this hasn’t been a deep dive into circular motion, we’ll do a bit more on it when we get into gravitation, but we hopefully have given you a bit of insight into what it’s all about.<span id='bVg6r2FqS'/>
- T - Indeed. As always, there’s never any substitute for doing a bunch of problems, but you know that by now.<span id='DRf6z1lrY'/>
- H - And that’s it for this one. See you next time.<span id='pQqrVuXmD'/>
