- WHAT is a Mastercast?<span id='wY5ZOY4qC'/>
    - A Mastercast is a cross between a Masterclass and a Podcast.<span id='RFnTL6Izk'/>
    - It's a conversation between a subject #expert and a #host about an academic subject at high-school level. (Typically for ages 13-19)<span id='JTj_dfz1y'/>
    - It is broadcast live and involves screen sharing the expert's screen and allowing the audience to hear the conversation between both parties<span id='xwDBDhOhY'/>
- WHY do we do them?<span id='23fgVYsas'/>
    - 2020 is a new era for online learning precipitated by the global coronavirus outbreak.<span id='oTowil4i_'/>
    - Most online learning is a poor substitute for face to face learning experiences<span id='cUVsR5BLw'/>
    - Our intention was to create a remote learning experience that was better than in-person learning. (see Basecamp and Remote Work https://basecamp.com/books/remote)<span id='QcZMZmEP5'/>
    - We concluded that it's the Energy and Interactivity of a live class that makes it work well, hence the idea of putting 2 teachers together to have a conversation about the topic. One is the subject expert, the other is the facilitator or host.<span id='249STIDMR'/>
    - The Podcast analogy extends to the idea of getting the world's best subject experts to teach any topic, wherever they are in the world.<span id='-Z3BHNk2q'/>
    - Also the vibe of a the Podcast medium is what makes it work well. It feels friendly and welcoming and intimate.<span id='q0-aGyEgx'/>
    - It takes the idea of Khan Academy and makes it personal. Makes it interactive. Makes it intimate. Makes it real. Better than real.<span id='j1QdRDsjt'/>
    - How many schools can get the world's best teachers into their real classrooms, for an in-depth conversation, through which they share their deep insights into subject success gleaned from years of teaching at the top level?<span id='BAEoLJ-ao'/>
    - The combination of a subject expert and a host gives it energy, enthusiasm, and also makes it a lot more enjoyable to deliver and to consume.<span id='bBILPPJRr'/>
- HOW does a Mastercast work?<span id='ZUxEXNp3L'/>
    - Overview<span id='3f97P9950'/>
        - #Mastercasts are designed to be self-contained entities, but they can also be part of a programme.<span id='jkaGaCEz8'/>
        - Typically they are a deep treatment of single [[Atomic notes]]<span id='HAZ8Bkhcq'/>
        - They are usually 1.5 hours in length, broken up into 3 #pomodoro sessions of 25 mins each. However a 2x #pom format is also popular - and also easier to schedule<span id='s8bjea3Vz'/>
        - The #expert is not just an expert in subject knowledge but it's likely they been teaching the subject at this level for a considerable period.<span id='LB88FCFJJ'/>
        - The #host is also likely to have some experience in the subject, at the very least they have studied the subject at the specific level and have a clear idea of how the subject fits in to the bigger picture.<span id='RQfHLe5sa'/>
        - The host's job is to adopt the mindset of the learner - always working at a meta-level, ensuring that the session has the appropriate balance between depth and accessibility. The #host acts as a #bridge between the subject #expert and the #audience<span id='W6Y_Dk172'/>
