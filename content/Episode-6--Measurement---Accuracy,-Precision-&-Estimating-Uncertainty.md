title: "Episode 6: Measurement - Accuracy, Precision & Estimating Uncertainty"

- H - Welcome back everybody. In part 1 we talked about the concepts of **uncertainty** and errors when taking **Measurement**s and now we’re going to talk about the difference between ****accuracy****and ****precision****. This is an interesting one.<span id='0UxbFPARd'/>
- T - Yep, so The ****accuracy****of a **Measurement** is how close the **Measurement** is to the true value of the quantity being measured.<span id='7EL6uz-aY'/>
- H - The **accuracy** of **Measurement**s is often reduced by systematic errors, which are difficult to detect even for experienced **Research** workers.<span id='I-k1h_ojO'/>
- T - The ****precision****of a **Measurement** is how close a number of **Measurement**s of the same quantity agree with each other. The **precision** is limited by the random errors. It may usually be determined by repeating the **Measurement**s.<span id='k4CnKeNTb'/>
- H - OK, so it always helps to give an example.<span id='bkIshvnCU'/>
- Imagine a target in an archery competition.<span id='yL3QtMhR4'/>
- An archer who was __accurate and precise__ would have all their shots close together and in the very centre of the target.<span id='1g1lSm5NX'/>
- T - An archer who was __accurate but not precise__ would have their shots spread out over the whole target, but spread out equally in all directions, so that their mean value was in the centre of the target.<span id='u1AVyhD10'/>
- H - An archer who was __precise but not accurate__ would have all their arrows very close together but not centred on the target. They would be off-target but close to each other.<span id='Fuz7mTR03'/>
- T - An archer who was __neither precise nor accurate__ would have all their arrows scattered across the whole target, but not equally, so that their mean value was not aligned with the centre of the target.<span id='SKmf7kH9t'/>
- H - This is a tremendously useful distinction for Physicists, but most people won’t understand what you are talking about.<span id='yBYg6XfFS'/>
- T - That’s OK. The examiners will. So, learn it!<span id='P7H_H--UA'/>
- H - Another, rather absurd example to illustrate the physicist’s definition of **accuracy** might be in a penalty shoot-out in football. (btw, for international students, here in the UK we call soccer football!)<span id='3DJmqzNvW'/>
- H - Let’s consider a team who missed just as many penalties to the left of the goal as they did to the right. They would be considered accurate because the __mean__ of their results would be bang in the middle of the goal!!!<span id='iXeKk0Wwg'/>
- T - And finally, here’s a bit more of a formal definition on the distinction:<span id='JJurdSaMT'/>
- H - The **accuracy** of a **Measurement** system is the degree of closeness of **Measurement**s of a quantity to that quantity's true value.<span id='M2Ip8WH9V'/>
- T - The **precision** of a **Measurement** system, related to reproducibility and repeatability, is the degree to which repeated **Measurement**s under unchanged conditions show the same results.<span id='xuEYfQVz3'/>
- H - Although the two words **precision** and **accuracy** can be synonymous in colloquial use, they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method.<span id='k1od0JDOG'/>
- **T - OK, so what must we understand?**<span id='mKFOyKdYp'/>
- H - Taking multiple readings is a good way to reduce random error.<span id='tGLkuy_4B'/>
- Taking 4 readings for every **Measurement** will halve the random error in your **Measurement**. Taking 9 readings will divide your error by three from the value you estimate from a single reading.<span id='gpQsDG0HI'/>
- In practice, taking 4 readings is nearly always sufficient to demonstrate that you have a good understanding of how to reduce errors.<span id='5Y9FFnyBt'/>
- Take 4 readings of every **Measurement** and repeat your whole experiment 9 times.<span id='OEL7D1U7E'/>
- For those of you that like statistical analysis, taking multiple readings reduces the error by a factor of the square root of the number of readings. (4 readings - square root of 4 equals 2, so the error reduces by a factor of 2, 9 readings - square root of 9 equals 3, so the error reduces by a factor of 3)<span id='98MVPlEuN'/>
- **What should we be able to do?**<span id='eyjG0HKTz'/>
- a) understand and explain the effects of systematic errors (including zero errors) and random errors in **Measurement**s<span id='ciWHHMEgo'/>
- b) understand the distinction between **precision** and **accuracy**<span id='X_ZVU0CG2'/>
- c) assess the **uncertainty** in a derived quantity by simple addition of absolute, fractional or percentage uncertainties (a rigorous statistical treatment is not required)<span id='z4Mj4FhUX'/>
- d) use error bars to represent uncertainties when plotting graphs of experimental results<span id='XAwgYcw2H'/>
- We’ve linked to a great treatment of how to do graphs in the resources section (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_qxohScVbk)<span id='7YJLu57H4'/>
- **How might we be tested on this?**<span id='7nVelvYOv'/>
- The practical examination and in any general question involving data.<span id='YoWzrpJex'/>
- **What common misconceptions are there in this topic?**<span id='IHz2y_UJx'/>
- **uncertainty** is not generally done well by A Level students. Especially when adding uncertainties as a result of taking readings of several quantities and then when performing calculations on those quantities.<span id='kGCNTj6aT'/>
- Graphs are also often done badly. One thing we see all the time, and this comes from poor teaching at GCSE, is in the way students plot points on a graph.<span id='rhxW-rWsM'/>
- Points should not be plotted with an X, they should be plotted using a cross with vertical and horizontal arms. I.e. more like a PLUS sign. +<span id='X98MaIVD_'/>
- The length of each arm of the plus-sign should be an indication of the **uncertainty** in the **Measurement** you recorded.<span id='h14-CvkPh'/>
- It’s too difficult to explain a graph in a podcast, so just remember x does NOT mark the spot. Not in [[Physics]].<span id='RVeVxtYHp'/>
- **What are the typical mistakes to avoid, pitfalls to look out for?**<span id='3OpK1v9Zn'/>
- Parallax error is one that a lot of experimenters miss. This occurs when there is a gap between the object you are looking at and the scale behind it, and when your eye is not in a straight line with both.<span id='QsNmqDUmg'/>
- The way to combat parallax error is to always make sure your observation device - i.e. your eye, is lined up directly with both the object you are measuring and the scale behind it.<span id='uWnzwquhY'/>
- Another tip is to keep the measuring instrument as close to the object as possible.<span id='YU85eL57N'/>
- We’ve linked to a good treatment explaining parallax error by Lewis Matheson in the resources section (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-vSdlJ-Fa8)<span id='ZZF1l3qP4'/>
- T- Okay that’s all we’ve got for now.<span id='XgMaWnV-J'/>
- H- Thanks for listening!<span id='dae0n-ytd'/>
- T- We’ll see you in the next one.<span id='0sdPmRK3w'/>
