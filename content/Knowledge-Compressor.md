            - <a id='eKvUGLJKp'/>Grounded claims are: **concise statements - grounded in context**
                - <a id='2lwP_NZWx'/>Our idea for grounded claims is rooted in **models of scientific argumentation** that also specify a scientific statement, linked to evidence, as a basic unit of scientific discourse [8, 9, 16].

        - <a id='OaGJ8RbqU'/>Eases cognitive cost of deciding which part of the document count as context, and interaction cost of precisely specifying contextual details.

        - <a id='hgKdHtque'/>UI
            - <a id='LaZklMJNh'/>How does it scale, and how do you work with large projects - do you keep adding to the same base, or have multiple sub-bases. (Would be cool to be able to build, for example building up to a claim, based on many sub-claims that all have evidence, and then linking to that claim in a broader context)
            - <a id='eXtoQVYrZ'/>You're assuming that all relevant information is co-located, and can be selected - perhaps this is the hallmark of a good paper? What if it's scattered around, you need two different pieces to create a claim etc?
            - <a id='y1ie7filH'/>How important is the zoomability? Have they done user-studies on this? Intuitively I feel like you get a lot of the "lossless compression" by automatically maintaining a link back to the original PDF and location, without offering the visual zooming, but I might be wrong
        - <a id='xTporiMoh'/>Interoperability
            - <a id='6tZOKScbd'/>Are there ways of exporting this data in a format that could be read for example by Roam? Would be great to grab the text of PDFs selected too, but still keep the link back to where it came from
            - <a id='cidq-SvDc'/>Ways in which this could interact with Roam, if Roam had a nice API - bringing these highlights into Roam (how to serialize from a 2D space?), but also grabbing Roam bullets and letting users visualize, map, link
        - <a id='czQPualL3'/>Functionality/tech
            - <a id='xHNeQwQ07'/>is there any kind of search (at least in the text you write yourself?) - apparently some newer version has search

        - <a id='9VIuKClZD'/>Other tools
            - <a id='FepLwieNa'/>Should definitively look at **Knowledge Forum**, how they use backgrounds, different views, rise-aboves etc (and talk to **Bodong Chen**). Also things like **Compendium** from **Knowledge Cartography** (I should revisit that book as well)
        - <a id='wJKegK2Ag'/>Collaboration
            - <a id='5CSxIGQ5l'/>Talking about sharing maps - give a new PhD student a map, this is what we know... Relevant to [[Three levels of Note taking]]. Social features, annotation, disagreement, discovery? Comparing between different graphs, linking to different graphs... 🤯
                - <a id='Jn7Kbowis'/>One thing is sharing maps in a small community, but what about publishing - what would it be like to publish a literature review written in such a way, where every claim links back - **citation ontologies** etc? Automatically import a citation ontology from another paper into your map?
                - <a id='pP6Qd28Zp'/>Perhaps search engines could index your claims, and know which are the claims in a certain paper, which can help other people searching, even without you exposing your notes and thoughts directly to them
    - <a id='q0fd-KPex'/>Some research showing that if you create a mindmap of a vacation planning and you share with someone, the categories you have (things to do with kids, what to bring) are actually more useful to the other person, than the items you put in the buckets... So categories/landscape is important.
    - <a id='DdiAyqWro'/>In **bio-informatics** they have guidelines for how to write clear natural language summaries of research - relevant for how to best write the "labels" for these claims
    - <a id='zBg_IUhXe'/>Also has a synthesis interface for writing, which can automatically search through your claims
