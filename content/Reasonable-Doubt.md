- Reasonable Doubt: __How to think in modern times__<span id='q5eNiQ0Qa'/>
- This is not really a guide on how to think. You know how to think anyway, the problem is if you're like the rest of us, you probably do a lot of thinking that just isn't very helpful.<span id='Ey4cQxqP4'/>
- What this guide attempts to do is to give you some helpful perspectives for living effectively in a world of constant change, with an often overwhelming supply of new information, ideas, theories, agendas and opportunities.<span id='bcLQMkmMy'/>
- The central focus of the approach is to get you to notice what you are thinking and to tip the balance of your thinking towards more helpful thoughts.<span id='5YtRqb5Jr'/>
- You are never going to escape worry completely. You will no doubt spend a portion of the rest of your life being anxious, fearful, scared, fretful, frustrated.<span id='lqrUEbtoe'/>
- But, you can improve your average...<span id='AoKlrHeaD'/>
- This essay sets out to do three things:<span id='frlg33nCN'/>
- 1. It aims to make it OK to have doubt, to be fearful, to worry. If you're worrying about something and you think it's wrong to worry, then you'll worry about worrying and you're then in a rapid downward spiral.<span id='FsjRMHRBi'/>
- 2. It hopes to raise your current level of awareness so that you begin to notice when you are thinking anything that isn't particularly helpful.<span id='F4LaU9Sek'/>
- 3. It aims to give you a few perspectives that can help you maintain a good average. We're not attempting to banish worry entirely. That's impossible. What we're trying to do is to raise your awareness sufficiently so that most of the time you are thinking stuff that's helpful rather than unhelpful.<span id='9xMN7jgq9'/>
- And that's it.<span id='TGLBunJFF'/>
- A good friend of mine, Jim Rai, came up with the concept of 'The 70% rule' which involves aiming to spend around 70% of your time on thoughts/feelings/actions that you'd ideally want to do and only 30% on things you wouldn't.<span id='TvKhDlP5S'/>
- A lot of people get put off by that because they think it's already admitting defeat by setting the bar too low. The wise man and the gambler both know that 70% right gets you just about anything you want!<span id='Tet75ahVi'/>
- It would involve you thinking the way you'd want for about 70% of the time. If 70% of your thoughts were helpful, you'd be not only rare, but unstoppable.<span id='bnpIBcSsS'/>
- So, let's talk about what Reasonable Doubt might look like...<span id='TbN1uqtrY'/>
- Well, first of all we are going to use something that makes it easy for us to raise our awareness of how we're thinking, to notice what we're up to.<span id='_20kqDf3T'/>
- We're going to use the 13/4. Why?<span id='k1dwAfy1j'/>
- Because it's the best system I know to effect a permanent change in behaviour and so until I find a better one I'm going to continue to use it!<span id='zZyGlQEzU'/>
- How does the 13/4 work?<span id='lztnKJ_XB'/>
- Well, we have a central focus that reflects the overall goal of the programme and then 12 aspects that we focus on one week at a time to bring about the change we desire.<span id='nQk2cS3Jy'/>
- The Central Focus<span id='YzFWqBj2A'/>
- The main goal of the programme is to replace the thoughts that aren't helpful with thoughts that are.<span id='fs7WM63E_'/>
- So, how do we know if a thought is helpful or not?<span id='wbt5dciMs'/>
- You just ask yourself this simple question:<span id='ejuCPZFIw'/>
- What WOULD you choose?<span id='Euo4pMCBC'/>
- If it's what you are currently thinking, then great, keep on thinking that thought.<span id='w2tPD6_XD'/>
- If what you're currently thinking is NOT what you'd choose to think, then we...<span id='NRZNk9Brc'/>
- Stop thinking it right?<span id='9e7T0OI9d'/>
- No.<span id='0fQGrLrk9'/>
- Not at all. That's where most people go wrong. We don't stop thinking it, we just NOTICE that it's not particularly helpful, that we wouldn't choose it, that it isn't serving us, but that we're doing it anyway.<span id='Y9A1fW_fV'/>
- There's real power in this simple realisation. The very fact of deciding not to resist the thought we currently have opens the door to all possible change.<span id='QbfAtJWsm'/>
- As soon as we make it bad to have a particular thought, we've created a problem: we now feel bad about having the thought that makes us feel bad.<span id='AUnAVHrSO'/>
- Our reasoning goes something like this:<span id='Sd9eArRxp'/>
- 'Oh there you go worrying again. You shouldn't be doing that. You know it's not good for you. You know it isn't helpful. You know it isn't going to get you where you want to go. You dumb ass. Stop it. Stop it now!'<span id='nrCsfOcOz'/>
- Now, there's nothing intrinsically wrong with wanting to stop having a negative thought. Absolutely fine to do that. However, you've got to be very careful about making it a bad thing to have an unhelpful thought.<span id='-dKWZtfBu'/>
- In my experience, humans move away from anything that makes them feel bad, and it's this awareness of their thinking that is making them feel bad. Not the thinking themselves. So, how do they solve the problem? They stop noticing their thinking!!!<span id='zGLDNFrLl'/>
- Which is the exact opposite of what we're trying to do here.<span id='71YWW0DBH'/>
- So, you've got to make it good to notice when you're doubtful, when you're worrying about something. And then make it ok to have those doubts.<span id='eMok6XCkJ'/>
- Make it absolutely ok to have those doubts. Make it great.<span id='TycsSm2XO'/>
- OK, I get it. Make it great to notice when you're doubting yourself, when you're worrying. Yes, useful.<span id='LrYInVB4i'/>
- But how does that actually help me replace this kind of negative thinking with something that would be a lot more helpful?<span id='_61ES93I6'/>
- If we move away from what makes us feel bad, then guess what? We move towards things that make us feel good.<span id='95HY1CtEP'/>
- So, we make it fun to notice how we're thinking. And then we do it more. We enjoy it.<span id='GZhrPxrQm'/>
- And guess what happens when we enjoy something? We stop worrying...<span id='m168lcFqe'/>
- Of course, we still have doubts. We still worry. But we've now made it OK to not be OK. And that's what creates the real change.<span id='-ykEeHouK'/>
- So, in practice, what we do is we just NOTICE what we're thinking by asking ourselves the most powerful question in our arsenal:<span id='LEBDccdHJ'/>
- __What WOULD I choose?_<span id='MRLIt2P-v'/>
- You get good at asking yourself this question and you've basically eradicated self-doubt, fear, worry, right there and then, for the rest of your life. Job done.<span id='sdVMe9cim'/>
- OK, so there's a bit more to it than that...<span id='sJrsX6QRt'/>
- While undoubtedly the very act of noticing will work for most of us, it'd be helpful to find a more systematic way of getting beyond the original doubting thought more regularly and with considerably less effort.<span id='VBqO1LwP3'/>
- So, what we do is this:<span id='t0Hv-S7_A'/>
- We ask ourselves this question:<span id='mvDfMPy2Z'/>
- What WOULD I choose?<span id='tzudWoA_O'/>
- If the answer is anything like 'Not this'<span id='Q4nObpRl2'/>
- Then we realise that we're doing something different from what we would choose to do.<span id='j_tVESCGO'/>
- Now, here's the kicker.<span id='bmnNhkxop'/>
- If we're doing anything different from what we would choose, what's the only thing that this can mean?<span id='3GDk2AZhH'/>
- It can only mean one thing - we're not choosing!<span id='-HGdiP1vY'/>
- That's so obvious people nearly always miss it.<span id='bcIAmljXX'/>
- If we WOULD choose to have a different thought, it can only mean that we're not choosing our thought.<span id='f3Ff7oyoO'/>
- So, if WE'RE not choosing our thought, how is it still happening?<span id='dabZD5sy0'/>
- I mean, we're doing it, and we're not choosing, so somehow, something else is choosing for us!<span id='AspC8Y-99'/>
- We say you're absolutely correct, something else IS choosing for you and that something else is called your script.<span id='ScE9odUwi'/>
- Well, we call it your script. We say that 'everything that isn't helpful, that you wouldn't choose, that doesn't serve you' is not you. It's your script.<span id='QR7kb9PNV'/>
- What's happened is that from a very early age you've observed situations, your parents, your peers, celebrities, teachers, adults you interact with, and they've behaved in a certain way.<span id='3mnfRxXGY'/>
- You may have not even been consciously aware of what was going on but you were learning how to deal with new information, experiences, situations, by observing how other people behaved.<span id='wKc_mzSH0'/>
- As you went through life, layers and layers of this 'script' was handed to you and you began to process information that you directly observed using it as a frame of reference.<span id='i5VF1Cjso'/>
- I don't want to get too deep here as delving into the script is a journey that never ends.<span id='oxV35QNMX'/>
- But all you have to do, whenever you respond to any external situation or information, is to notice what you're thinking/feeling.<span id='FxvtMbSZU'/>
- If what you are thinking/feeling is what you WOULD choose, then it's you. It must be. It's what you WOULD choose, so it's the authentic you. Genuinely behaving according to your intuition, your conscious beliefs.<span id='LReGhKgMm'/>
- If however, what you're thinking/feeling is NOT what you WOULD choose, then it's your script.<span id='NP9yY6ava'/>
- You don't have to worry about it at all. It's just your script.<span id='eqYXeaxH4'/>
- Your script contains the reference points:<span id='mUMdl2qAD'/>
- OK, when X happens, this is how you should feel.<span id='pK9_gQIHr'/>
- When someone you love says something mean to you, you should feel bad.<span id='IhA6jSg2f'/>
- When someone cuts in front of you into your line of traffic, you should get angry.<span id='GA-hYPevB'/>
- When people don't listen to your ideas, you should feel rejected.<span id='kqEib8QbV'/>
- When you get overlooked for a promotion, you should feel a failure.<span id='T8xhv2fR2'/>
- When you have an important meeting coming up, you should feel anxious.<span id='8Txz4kKiy'/>
- It's thoughts like these that come from the script, not from you.<span id='dnnw-Ex7p'/>
- Hmmm... I'm not totally sure about this - how do we know these thoughts aren't ME? I mean, obviously I'd prefer them to be from my script, but maybe these thoughts are genuinely from me, maybe that's just what I'm like?<span id='a7jyzjfUh'/>
- A natural response, and an interesting line of thought in itself. There's actually quite an easy way to work out whether it's genuinely you, or whether it's your script:<span id='nYEiKYU7W'/>
- Just ask yourself what you WOULD choose?<span id='UecsOzfSK'/>
- If the thought that you're having isn't helpful, it isn't serving you, then you wouldn't choose it.<span id='Mww0KYghf'/>
- If you wouldn't choose it, then it's not you - it's your script. It has to be - that's the definition of the script:<span id='xQz15Gjz_'/>
- Everything that you don't want, that isn't helpful, that isn't serving you.<span id='T6u03vEIr'/>
- Sometimes the script itself will reject this simplicity. It will come up with a line of thinking as follows:<span id='0h550zFox'/>
- I know this ability to differentiate between my genuine thoughts and the thoughts the script is choosing is brilliant. I know that just by asking myself the simple ’what would I choose’ question, I can easily determine whether it not it’s actually me or my script choosing, but...<span id='ENT-GJSsD'/>
- ...it can't really be that simple can it?<span id='yzVvnjh9r'/>
- I mean, life's not like that. I've got to accept some responsibility for these negative thoughts surely? I mean, I can't just get away with it like that, can I?<span id='BCd-c6Khc'/>
- Well, this is where the genius of the approach really comes in to play.<span id='7my-5Mgir'/>
- What would you choose to believe?<span id='3Ir1E_Pom'/>
- Would you choose to think that it can't be that simple? that nothing this good can actually be real, that this approach can't really be the truth?<span id='__Wzjhepu'/>
- Of course you wouldn't!<span id='Vw6V8Erx3'/>
- You'd always choose for life to be simple rather than complicated, you'd always choose for things that were really helpful to be true, you'd never choose for things to be difficult.<span id='DzUDjE-x6'/>
- Of course, sometimes the script will seduce you with a brilliant piece of logic. It will say something like this:<span id='5XO3ptvtv'/>
- Maybe anxiety about this project would be helpful? Maybe me getting stressed about the outcome will make me perform better? Maybe feeling frustrated about this situation will get me to take action?<span id='aRk-4wVjl'/>
- All these are actually almost good points. Certainly worth exploring and I'm going to give a couple of scenarios that may help you see that these positions are in most cases not only unhelpful, but they could even be damaging, despite their attractive logic.<span id='gW00LmQJk'/>
- 1. Peak performers.<span id='Cz7BC65sQ'/>
- Let's consider the case of an Olympic athlete approaching their imminent event.<span id='raJL1v_yd'/>
- They've got the entirety of their training, their sporting life, their future, their ambition at stake in the Olympic final.<span id='yPse5K8W3'/>
- They've got the same dilemma as you:<span id='W_YRSpI0b'/>
- What would they choose to be thinking about regarding their imminent performance?<span id='pEMkrsfW3'/>
- a) Relaxed confidence:<span id='1eOHENa7r'/>
- That this is going to go well, that everything is going to click, that they’ll realize their full potential, that all their training had been worth it, this is what life is all about?<span id='4Gd_gllq9'/>
- Or<span id='-rvcI9A6r'/>
- b) Unbridled anxiety:<span id='V97wL9h9R'/>
- That they won't get a good start, that something might go wrong, that they'll mess up, that all their training has been a waste of time, that maybe they should have done something else with their life?<span id='vEbhj7KG0'/>
- Ok, that example appears absurd, but is it really any different from you and anything that you're doing?<span id='F6EvdGOtu'/>
- You nearly always have two fairly well polarised states of being with regard to any situation.<span id='pAnUQbQ2V'/>
- These two states are opposite ends of the scale of ’you'<span id='ykOrGXvE9'/>
- At one end of the scale we have your intuition: the authentic you, your gut feel, your integrity pattern...<span id='dTR0VEbKx'/>
- At the other end of the scale you have your script: everything that isn't helpful, that doesn't make you feel good, that you don't want...<span id='ZTnw5X7tb'/>
- And all of life is a daily dance between these two opposing positions, a continuous battle in the fight to discern the difference.<span id='q3JibLgod'/>
- The easiest way to work out when it's your intuition and when it's your script?<span id='iFFP7k11X'/>
- What WOULD you choose?<span id='l8HxDu_rm'/>
