- T - So, in the last episode we talked about frictional **force**s and pressure and in this one we’re going to talk about **force**s that cause things to fall over.<span id='rwWRCtURm'/>
- H - Sweet. Yes, Not only can a **force**, damage, deform or accelerate an object, but it can also cause an object to fall over. How good is that?<span id='VnJ__4ByQ'/>
- T - It’s very exciting. We know this intuitively, but it’s something that we haven’t yet considered. At GCSE level you hear about a **force** as a push, a pull or a turn and it’s this turning effect that we’ll be having a look at today.<span id='J6FwA03Uh'/>
- H - Yes, let’s consider the ice skating scenario again. Or roller-skating, for those listeners who haven’t been ice-skating!<span id='zy_umvYbv'/>
- T - OK, go on. Let’s imagine a friend of yours, who’s standing at the edge of the ice, but not on it, gives you a big push to send you across the ice. It’s possible, especially if they push you high up on your body, that they cause you to topple over, rather than accelerate.<span id='sMSwG875O'/>
- H - Why do some **force**s cause things to change position and therefore accelerate, and other **force**s cause things to fall over?<span id='PuPexN6kk'/>
- T - It all depends on HOW the **force** is applied to the object, and we need to bring in two new concepts to make this easy to understand.<span id='dGp-FJtv-'/>
- H - The first is the concepts of the centre of mass of an object, and the second is the concept of the torque of a **force**, also known as ‘turning effect’.<span id='mNUTlA9UX'/>
- T - So, what is the centre of mass of an object?<span id='0TqSRjpXC'/>
- H -  It’s an imaginary point inside an object, through which the entire mass of an object can be considered to be located.<span id='3gpMaqZt-'/>
- T - That sounds a bit weird.<span id='GrspAHQ2E'/>
- H - it is a bit weird, but it’s pretty helpful when doing calculations and it fits in with observations, hence it’s ok to use. In particular, it’s useful when working out whether an object will accelerate or fall over when you push it.<span id='apog1RSBT'/>
- T - In general, if you apply the **force** on a line through the centre of mass, the object will accelerate only.<span id='Sut5Tn2IL'/>
- H - And, if you apply your **force** off-centre, i.e. so it doesn’t go through the centre of mass of the object, then you will cause the object to turn, to rotate and possibly to topple. Of course, like all of [[Physics]] it’s a bit more complicated than that, but that’s basically the essence.<span id='T-v_4GQp2'/>
- T - You mean, you could have an object that accelerates and turns at the same time?<span id='GyJ0C8-Kn'/>
- H - Indeed you can. And that’s how a free-kick expert like Cristiano Ronaldo manages to be so effective when he strikes the ball. He hits it just a tiny bit off-centre, so the ball spins rapidly when it flies through the air. This turning effect he imparts on the ball, causes it to spin rapidly and subsequently change direction as it moves through the air, due to complex rotational fluid dynamics, making it extremely difficult to catch.<span id='R7nCG6xhV'/>
- T - [[Physics]] is everywhere!<span id='TMGKaDXAV'/>
- H - Indeed it is.<span id='DLtucatSp'/>
- T - So, how do we calculate this?<span id='Ba-jKT9OF'/>
- H - Once again, the PROCEDURAL knowledge we need to solve these kinds of problems at A Level [[Physics]] is very straightforward. The torque of a **force** is simply the size of the **force** multiplied by how far its line of action is from the centre of mass of the object.<span id='M5SB1e_9P'/>
- T - Right, so a 10 newton **force** applied 0.2 metres from the centre of mass of an object, will give the object a turning effect of 10 newtons times 0.2 metres = 2 Newton metres<span id='T5yihzskK'/>
- H - And what’s interesting is that this is a turning effect due to a **force** being a certain distance from the centre of mass of an object, and it has the units of Newton metres, or Nm. We find these units in other places in [[Physics]] as well. When we move a **force** through a certain distance we have to do some work and so the units of work are **force** x Distance which is also Newtons times Metres.<span id='AYPCgiWbe'/>
- T - Does that mean that Torque is actually equal to the **work done**? Is a turning effect the same as energy?<span id='lm7bra2su'/>
- H - Actually no. Not quite, but very nearly. Torque and Energy both have the same units - joules, but since a torque has direction, it is a vector quantity, whereas energy has no direction and so it is a scalar quantity. Very unusual that two different quantities, Energy and Torque can have the same units, yet mean quite different things. (For Mathematicians, Technically, Torque is the cross product of **force** x Distance, and Energy is the dot product of **force** x Distance)<span id='kIv13V19H'/>
- T - Yep. That’s how we’ve set it up. Of course, there’s no such thing as energy or torque. Both of these are human constructs, that help us make sense of what we observe. And they’re useful concepts because they give testable predictions.<span id='GV3N_LJNr'/>
- H - But we don’t have to worry about the philosophical problems of vectors and scalars having the same units. That’s for philosophers to worry about…<span id='AGQ_-Jr-c'/>
- T - So, how do we do problems with these turning effect questions?<span id='WTkvfyLCs'/>
- H - Well, as always, the best way to get the procedural knowledge you need is to do problems. Lots of them. But in general, all you’re ever going to be doing is working out the turning effect of a **force** about a fixed point by drawing the line that the **force** is pointing in and multiplying the value of the **force** by the perpendicular distance from that line to the pivot point.<span id='MAg02GKVQ'/>
- T - OK, so working out **force** x Distance to pivot<span id='Xab7xMd39'/>
- H - Basically, yes. And when you have the **force** of gravity, you have to assume that it acts as if the whole mass of the object was in one place, at the centre of mass of the object. The gravitational **force** always acts straight towards the centre of the gravitational field, which for all A Level problems is just straight towards the ground.<span id='wTUI6ovW6'/>
- T - So the direction of the Weight of an object is always straight down to the ground, from the centre of mass of the object?<span id='Y-BNZyM-z'/>
- H - Precisely. Unless told otherwise, you can consider the entire mass of an object to acting from its centre of mass, and the weight is straight down. If you’re not told this, you can assume that it is true, since you will only ever get objects of uniform density in A Level questions.<span id='MRHacows5'/>
- T -  Uniform density? We haven’t really covered density yet.<span id='BBvWZXPmO'/>
- H - The density of an object is just its mass per unit volume, or how many kilogrammes of mass are in each metre cubed of the object. Water for example has a density of approximately 1000 kg per metre cubed, whereas Aluminium has a density of around 2,700 kg per metre cubed.<span id='B-poQAvNz'/>
- T - OK, so what affects density? Well, there’s a few things. The mass of the individual building blocks of the thing, i.e. the Hydrogen, Oxygen or Aluminium atoms, and the way the basic building blocks are all joined up. Literally, how much space there is between each building block.<span id='Y7P7GA0wR'/>
- H - In all A Level [[Physics]] questions, we assume that objects have uniform density, unless specifically told otherwise, and this just means that we can assume the centre of mass of an object is located physically in the exact centre of the object.<span id='FPP-bRs_E'/>
- T - So, when doing problems involving turning effects, one thing we need to do is to take advantage of the fact that a rotation of a body is a change in the state of motion of the body.<span id='nP4Q2VCit'/>
- H - And this just means that if the body is in equilibrium, not only are there no unbalanced **force**s acting on the body, but also there are no unbalanced torques acting on the body.<span id='Kl0j6a8bP'/>
- T - Say that again? What do you mean exactly.<span id='bdXVXiLHp'/>
- H - It just means that you know that not only are all the horizontal and vertical **force**s balanced, but also, there is no resultant turning effect in any direction. In practice this means that if you choose any point on the object, the clockwise turning effects are exactly balanced by the anti-clockwise turning effects.<span id='GaYdt5bwo'/>
- T - OK, right. So the sum of **force** times distance clockwise, is equal to the sum of **force** times distance anticlockwise.<span id='Pu3t1oiLw'/>
- H - This is the principle of Moments, and it is very useful. If a collection of **force**s is in complete equilibrium, you can choose any point you like and ‘take moments’ about that point, and they will be equal and opposite.<span id='yaSpPhVHh'/>
- T - And ‘taking moments’ is just a funny way of saying ‘add up all the __**force** times distance__ bits in the clockwise direction, and it will be equal to all the __**force** time distance__ bits in the opposite direction’<span id='2jP7hYb4n'/>
- H - So, next up in this section is to revisit the idea of pressure, but this time in application to liquids.<span id='VWgMcKwHr'/>
- T - This can be treated quite easily: the deeper you are, the more pressure there is. There you go. Done.<span id='6Augm3ZWN'/>
- H - But it’s interesting how we arrive at that simplicity in liquids.<span id='eApz9dDU9'/>
- T - Yes, it is, absolutely. Let’s have a look at it. From the work you’ve now done, you should have the idea that the pressure on something is equal to the **force** on the thing divided by the area of the thing.<span id='8VwCWmpNi'/>
- H - So, let’s consider the pressure on the bottom of a swimming pool that is 3 metres deep and contains water.<span id='RaCKh96G_'/>
- T - The **force** on the bottom of the pool clearly comes from the weight of all the water, which is equal to the volume of the pool times the density of water.<span id='eAD6Yw2v5'/>
- H - Let’s say the pool was 10 metres wide, 50 metres long and 3 m deep. That means that the surface area of the pool is 10 times 50 equals 500 metres squared, and that the volume of water in the pool will be just this surface area times the depth of the pool, which will be 500 metres squared times 3 metres, which equals 1500 metres cubed of water.<span id='lkrW8dPJR'/>
- T - If the density of water is approximately 1000 kg per metre cubed, that means that the total mass of water is equal to 1000 kg times 1500 metres cubed equals 1.5 million kg.<span id='ClfP-JBHB'/>
- H - Pretty heavy.<span id='NUSd32JnY'/>
- T - The weight of this water is 10 Newtons per kg, so that means that the **force** on the bottom of the pool is 15 million newtons.<span id='rmWxrbLz4'/>
- H - And then the pressure, given by **force** divided by area, is equal to 15 million newtons divided by the surface area of the pool floor, which as we worked out earlier was 500 metres squared.<span id='oIKqyaJwW'/>
- T - So, that gives us a pressure of 30,000 Newtons per square metre.<span id='SVDaDRDC1'/>
- H - However, the neat thing to notice is that we used the calculation of the surface area of the pool twice: once when working out the volume of water, and once when working out the surface area of the bottom of the pool.<span id='9nkyExsxr'/>
- T - These two cancel each other out, so we could have worked out the same result without knowing either of them!<span id='-uqELhTdZ'/>
- H - OK, so that means that the pressure on the floor of the swimming pool doesn’t depend on the surface area of the pool.<span id='k3M5Nq0tA'/>
- T - That sort of makes sense though, doesn’t it? It makes sense that the pressure at one point on the bottom, shouldn’t depend on how wide the pool is, or how long it is.<span id='LQI11Bdx9'/>
- H - Absolutely, it makes sense, but it’s interesting none the less to just realise that the pressure at the bottom of a whole load of water only depends on the depth of the water, the density of the water and the gravitational field strength.<span id='eqHAJqwnr'/>
- T - And in most cases, 2 of those three things are the same.<span id='JqhkL6_4v'/>
- H - Absolutely, so basically, you can just simplify this and say that the pressure due to liquids is proportional to the depth and you can calculate it by just multiplying the depth by the density of the liquid and then by the gravitational field strength.<span id='8YZ8kfWyQ'/>
- T - Pretty simple.<span id='ND1TJGHyg'/>
- H - Yep, and that’s about it. Nothing really to catch you out here. Occasionally you’re going to have different density liquids, say like alcohol, or mercury, but it’s pretty straightforward and depth is the only thing you have to really worry about.<span id='4rI7eHoa6'/>
- T - OK, so that brings us to the end of section 5 in this programme.<span id='-eDsBsdDb'/>
- H - We’re sorry it was so long, and as always, there’s nothing that’s going to be more helpful than going through lots of problems, but hopefully you should have a feel for some of the more interesting ideas behind **force**s.<span id='LZzKwS8hU'/>
- T - Indeed. Well, it’s bye for now and see you in the next one.<span id='IEVR3v1Eu'/>
