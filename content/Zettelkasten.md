title: "Zettelkasten"
---

- From Conor White-Sullivan’s article - creator of Roam Research<span id='g2br6FPo0'/>
- The **Zettelkasten** is basically the [[GTD]] for Intellectual Progress<span id='BrtlNgCW9'/>
- It makes the unpredictable work of creative insight into a habit -- and makes it much much easier to write papers<span id='O_NJonsP_'/>
- Actually has a lot in common with **Just in Time Project Management** from **Tiago Forte**<span id='-Dhkfuwa-'/>
- And here’s a good treatment by Cristian https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/<span id='dvve3gW6q'/>
- And David B Clear’s summary on medium: https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125<span id='33t8pkhnE'/>
- Particularly the idea of **Intermediate Packets**<span id='8BHf-sH-m'/>
- Instead of delivering one big lump of value at the very end, you stage your progress in a series of short, intense sprints, ending each one with a tangible, intermediate deliverable, like a set of notes, a brainstorm, a series of examples, an outline, a prototype, or a draft.<span id='96bCYlnF1'/>

- The core idea in the **Zettelkasten** is that every time you read something worthwhile, you write up each idea in your own words -- and link those ideas to the other notes that are related<span id='PLCJ1Jatv'/>
- When you're writing research papers or blog-posts you should never be starting with a blank page -- you instead want to just pull on a "thread" and have a whole stream of thoughts -- already written in complete sentences, in your own words, to build off of<span id='qYkF_AuXz'/>
- **** Include link on threads from **Visakan V**'s twitter<span id='WWrMeft2h'/>
- Especially if you're doing a lot of interdisciplinary work, or if a lot of your work builds off similar ideas, these small chunks may be useful over and over again<span id='9iwJ9NGLg'/>
