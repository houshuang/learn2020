- Springs are fun because they can be stretched (extended) and squashed (compressed) and we can therefore easily see the effects of **force**s.<span id='ZCUj8HILX'/>
- We use the extension of springs to measure the #[[**force** of gravity]] on objects, which we call weight.<span id='vtYa-hm-N'/>
- We are justified in doing this because springs change their shape predictably when acted on by relatively small **force**s. In Physics we often call predictable behaviour a law<span id='4eRiXExW8'/>
- Robert Hooke first popularised this behaviour of springs, so we call it **Hooke's Law**.<span id='9XUlCcdbY'/>
- General Behaviour of Springs<span id='KQzCg82Ml'/>
    - To stretch, bend or compress an object, more than one **force** has to be applied:<span id='ehWz-4NVp'/>
        - If a single **force** is applied to an object, it will move in the direction of the applied **force**.<span id='oXMDBfczh'/>
        - If an object is pulled in more than one direction by two or more **force**s, the object will change shape either permanently or temporarily.<span id='A3JZK4xqQ'/>
        - If the object is pulled by a single **force** at one end with the other end fixed at a point - in Physics terms, this is the same as if the spring is being pulled by two opposite **force**s, so it will also change shape - stretch or compress.<span id='_u_xSb9gk'/>
    - Deformation (this means changing shape) can be of two kinds:<span id='coEAPklmr'/>
        - Elastic Deformation<span id='mSz2YlrO-'/>
            - The object returns to its original shape once the **force** has been removed<span id='_2BbZHE5I'/>
                - Examples:<span id='7ZdTRk4eo'/>
                    - Elastic band<span id='RGO1GWIk0'/>
                    - A bungee cord<span id='i9JmuG92a'/>
                    - Spring stretched a small **force**<span id='B3vACZB9G'/>
                    - A wire stretched by a small **force**<span id='y_khYAV9k'/>
        - Plastic Deformation<span id='aQIHAqU6s'/>
            - The object does not return to its original shape once the **force** has been removed<span id='JLhCWMDac'/>
            - Its shape has therefore been permanently changed or deformed<span id='BXWiI_Rlr'/>
                - Examples:<span id='gm70mROAv'/>
                    - An elastic band stretched beyond breaking point<span id='QNTFGMbzm'/>
                    - Spring stretched by a big **force**<span id='-wm8WAtrf'/>
- **Hooke's Law**<span id='MBC1WTSCv'/>
    - 1. **Hooke's Law**: Extension $$\propto$$ Load; or $$F=-kx$$<span id='JlxF20OeU'/>
        - Robert Hooke was an English scientist who did a lot of investigative work with springs. He first proposed a pattern of behaviour that became known as Hooke’s Law.<span id='LAt1pFCpx'/>
        - This law states that how much a spring changes its shape depends on how much **force** you apply to it. Or in more formal [[Physics]] terms: the extension (or compression) of a spring is proportional to the **force** applied to the spring<span id='ezAB6hGej'/>
        - So, double the load on a spring, double its extension:<span id='eE_HKhw95'/>
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2F6vjvAFZB56?alt=media&token=d98f1dad-826b-4672-bd4c-ab6e288bc26e)<span id='EjBwFYquu'/>
        - Plotted on a graph this will look like a straight line:<span id='eFBhtvTDl'/>
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2FNQt8lCY-Mn?alt=media&token=8d1e227c-d3cd-48f8-a26d-88fff0502eb6)<span id='cgfTQzc7U'/>
        - And this law holds pretty well for small **force**s, in the diagram above, the graph is a straight line, showing a direct proportional relationship between extension and load. In fact the spring follows **Hooke's Law** for as long as the line is straight. However, once the extension goes beyond the elastic limit, the line is no longer straight and **Hooke's Law** is no longer obeyed.<span id='Wl4bTCMv-'/>
        - The **force** in this context is often called a ‘load’ which comes from the use of the word ‘load’ as something you carry.<span id='ExcQORfGF'/>
        - So, for small loads Hooke’s Law is a good approximation. It works pretty well with springs and the extent to which a spring obeys Hooke’s Law is something we look at quite a lot in this area of [[Physics]].<span id='IZyuodNW-'/>
        - And if something has a directly proportional relationship, we can write it in a standard way in [[Physics]], can’t we?<span id='L6cQUDkap'/>
        - Indeed we can. Instead of saying the extension is proportional to the load, we can write a formula F = -kx, where F is the load, x is the extension, and -k is the ‘constant of proportionality’ between the two. Rearranging the equation, we can write k is equal to F/x, and so we get the idea of the idea of k as a measure of how much **force** you need to extend a spring by a given amount, and we think of this as the ‘stiffness’ of the spring.<span id='cFnkZ6DBr'/>
        - $$F=-kx$$<span id='vxBhIAFJT'/>
        - This got tricky all of a sudden.<span id='VznUqZL9q'/>
        - Well it’s certainly not tricky in terms of the maths. You measure the **force** (F) you apply to a spring, you measure the amount it extends its length (x) and you divide these two numbers to get a value for the ‘spring constant’ which we call ‘k’<span id='hx3x3paEj'/>
        - Yes, so k is equal to F divided by x. OK, but why is it minus k then, and not just k?<span id='-1G6OI3yh'/>
        - Good question. It’s really just a convention. The minus is because the **force** is acting in the opposite direction to the direction of extension. If you pull the spring ‘down’ the **force** that acts on the spring as a result of its ‘extended’ shape will act in the opposite direction to the extension and tend to ‘restore’ the spring to its original shape.<span id='XmUVljynC'/>
        - Similarly if you compress a spring, the **force** on the spring as a result of its compression will tend to restore the spring to its original shape, working against the direction in which you applied the **force** to compress it in the first place.<span id='uL9WllwKZ'/>
        - So, that’s why we write the formula as F equals minus k x:<span id='WudJVxFlu'/>
        - $$F=-kx$$<span id='OZfPr9ZFh'/>
        - Hooke’s Law is a pretty nice one. You usually just extend a spring by adding a bunch of masses to it and record the length of the spring each time you add a new mass.<span id='Efm0uoTwz'/>
        - At some point the spring is likely to deform and beyond this point the spring won’t return to its original shape. It will have been permanently deformed. Up to this point, known as the elastic limit of the spring, even though the spring is extended, when the **force** is removed, the spring returns to its original shape.<span id='aChY6XpLS'/>
        - In this straight-line region of the graph, the spring is said to obey Hooke’s Law. As soon as the spring goes past its elastic limit, some of the atoms have been permanently moved in relation to each other and as a consequence, the spring no longer follows Hooke’s Law. If you plot all your data on a graph, you can identify that point and you can also work out the spring constant, k, by calculating the gradient of the line for the region where it is straight.<span id='yO6vqaai6'/>
        - In summary, all you need to know is that you'll get a straight line when you plot the extension against the load with a relationship that can be written as:<span id='eM2GZCKfO'/>
            - $$F=-kx$$<span id='N84rScxeG'/>
            - where $$F$$ is the Load in newtons<span id='MrXNaupAE'/>
            - $$x$$ is the extension in metres<span id='8mBk66GJW'/>
            - $$k$$ is the 'spring constant' which is a fixed number for a given spring<span id='EEn9ZxeXx'/>
    - 2. **work done** extending a spring $$x$$ metres by a load of $$F$$ newtons<span id='-6dIDKVdj'/>
        - So, if you stretch a spring a distance $$x$$ by adding a load to it, how much work have you done? And therefore how much energy is stored in the spring?<span id='rfqEOkTgV'/>
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FLearn2020zettelkasten%2Fn05dh5oKo9?alt=media&token=d8da8924-c8af-46bc-9118-5d8e4d6b91d9)<span id='1BfXadpsb'/>
        - If we assume that no energy is lost to the surroundings, then we can use the fact that **work done** = **force** x Distance<span id='qXmcr4GH1'/>
            - $$W = Fx$$<span id='mLfcv5aGr'/>
            - where $$W$$ is the **work done**<span id='ruB4GGRZU'/>
            - $$F$$ is the load<span id='YUgyBkgUH'/>
            - $$x$$ is the extension<span id='mDnZ0bMSY'/>
            - However, we also know that $$F=-kx$$, which means that we might expect the formula to be:<span id='yFWoNIL-L'/>
            - $$W = Fx = -kxx = -kx^2$$<span id='W9GSNFQe5'/>
            - However we have to be a little bit careful here because the **force** F stretching the spring was not constant the whole time we stretched the spring<span id='ax9THuzpu'/>
            - For the first part of the stretch we had a smaller load and we gradually increased the load up to the final load $$F$$ which was the maximum load.<span id='Nvsg8Nmz4'/>
            - In fact the load increased steadily from zero to a maximum value $$F$$<span id='QZfhcFThl'/>
            - So, we replace $$F$$ in the equation above with the average load as the  spring was stretched which is just $$(F/2)$$<span id='on9fA23Kc'/>
            - This means that the **work done** in stretching the spring is given by:<span id='fUMta-OHs'/>
            - $$W=(1/2)Fx$$; which can also be written as  $$W=-(1/2)kx^2$$<span id='HBabbOe4E'/>
            - This equates to the area under the curve as shown above and can be also thought of as the area of the right-angled triangle with $$base = F$$ and $$height = x$$<span id='Pw9KFCcsx'/>
            - Both of these methods are shown in the above diagram<span id='p_9MxDYFT'/>
