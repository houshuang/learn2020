- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]] - Tom Cassidy & Henry Cassidy<span id='O88XIG0Md'/>
- Welcome to the Advanced Level [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]] by Tom Cassidy and Henry Cassidy.<span id='AOaQKKcUs'/>
- Tom Cassidy is the Principal of Cambridge Leadership College and ()at the time of creating this podcast), Henry Cassidy is a [[Physics]] Undergraduate at Cambridge University.<span id='6BlUdOVFZ'/>
- The syllabus followed is broadly for the Cambridge International Examination Board International A Level but it also serves as a solid foundation for AP Physics and IB Standard Level.<span id='mm7rg2nkK'/>
- This podcast series will be covering the essential questions in [[Physics]] and our approach is to make it relevant, memorable and helpful in order to secure top grades in the A Level examinations.<span id='4sad0KJ6Q'/>
- You will need to supplement these podcasts with plenty of practice and experiments. In a practical subject like [[Physics]], there is no substitute for playing around with stuff, for tinkering with equipment and conducting formal experiments.<span id='OursGO-ps'/>
- In this first **Episode** we are going to do an introduction to [[Physics]] and attempt to cover the following questions:<span id='mXYzAmUt4'/>
- 1. What is [[Physics]]?<span id='s809Gyl3z'/>
- 2. Why should we learn it?<span id='-VpUskDT9'/>
- 3. What’s the easiest way to make sense of it?<span id='uU_D9udtl'/>
- 4. What’s the easiest way to get top grades in the A level examinations?<span id='WhnxQl29B'/>
- 5. What **Maths** am I going to need?<span id='yRvnOun9a'/>
- 6. What topics are in the syllabus?<span id='xUc8YB194'/>
- T- 1. So first of all, what is [[Physics]]?<span id='Vn9aH-S5I'/>
- H- [[Physics]] is the word we give to the study of the observable universe, and the attempt to make testable future predictions about how the universe may behave.<span id='1kyJj1qHU'/>
- T- In simple language physicists look at stuff, suggest what might be going on and then test those suggestions.<span id='vr63JLcnr'/>
- H- Yes we:<span id='iL6ORJUmO'/>
- Observe. Suggest. Test.<span id='XcRtY_4yh'/>
- T- In more technical language, physicists observe certain phenomena, create a hypothesis to explain what might be causing these phenomena, use this hypothesis to predict what might happen in future scenarios, and then test this hypothesis by conducting experiments.<span id='JCbSYJGbE'/>
- H- And the golden rule of the physicist is this:<span id='-_78kt7F4'/>
- ‘the extent to which our experiments agree with our predictions is the extent to which our theory is useful.’<span id='lb9iqGEMj'/>
- Physicists use the concept of ‘models’ to help them do this.<span id='7CjFlHbN2'/>
- T- The only way we can ever understand something new is by relating it to something we already know. Everybody needs a ‘frame of reference’ when considering new information, so that we can say:<span id='-P5G9Je60'/>
- ‘oh, well, it’s a bit like…’<span id='FdgUGQk9k'/>
- H- for example:<span id='yGxFfj0YT'/>
- the way a gas behaves in a container is a bit like a bunch of ping pong balls banging around a gymnasium.<span id='wb46nUBuf'/>
- a current flowing through an electric circuit is a bit like the water flowing in a water slide system<span id='nN2UxARI9'/>
- an atomic bond connecting two atoms is a bit like a metal spring connecting two tennis balls<span id='RV1pUN-vZ'/>
- T- 2. Why should we learn it?<span id='vfNWGyPOx'/>
- H- Clearly, we should learn it because it’s awesome. But on the off chance you’re listening to this because all you want is a good grade in your A Level and not because you want to become a nobel prize-winning physicist, the main reason for studying [[Physics]] could be because the skill of creating models to help you understand things is very useful in many areas of life, particularly in the field of problem-solving.<span id='b34YZJfN8'/>
- T- Getting good at relating something new and uncertain to something you know well will serve you handsomely in any future career.<span id='6F_SvADd4'/>
- H - Plus it's way awesome. If you want to really see the power of science in action, just watch the Matt Damon movie ‘The Martian’. It's got a ton of really neat science.<span id='kQ0y36WOh'/>
- T - Technically we should use more precise language than a ‘ton’ because that's a little misleading.<span id='yGCwa9WWF'/>
- H - But one of the things we talk about a lot is the meaningfulness of Science. And in order to convey meaning to non-scientists, we have to use the language that they understand and commonly use. Like ‘loads’, ‘tons’, ‘massive’, ‘bunch’ etc.<span id='iOwv7Gk1O'/>
- T - We will also be explaining how this imprecise use of language can lead to misconceptions.<span id='7JKiOLQHA'/>
- H - But not in this introduction, there’ll be plenty of time for that later...<span id='48VAQjoDz'/>
- H - OK, so part 3. What’s the easiest way to make sense of [[Physics]]?<span id='f_GPWZ8tC'/>
- T- The best way to make sense of [[Physics]] is going to depend on how your individual brain works and there is no one way that will work best for everybody.<span id='_mJOFRq-M'/>
- H- Indeed there are many different ways of thinking about [[Physics]], but in our experience the ones that are most effective are the ones that are the most visual.<span id='iHhQ93Ct3'/>
- T- Humans have a tremendously effective visual memory and can remember a huge amount of visual detail. The old saying ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’ is very true.<span id='oUBtxJQty'/>
- H- So, our approach in this series is to get you to create pictures that represent the [[Physics]] we’re talking about.<span id='q0DDyw1-H'/>
- T- Podcasts are excellent for this. It’s a bit like comparing a radio show with a TV show.<span id='-E8-rfIyH'/>
- In a TV show, you are supplied with both the words and the images, so your brain doesn’t have to work as hard, and consequently the images are not locked down into your memory as effectively.<span id='TLXtaUtLd'/>
- Whereas in a radio show, your brain has to conjure up the images as you go along and this ‘creation’ is far more neurologically profound and consequently, the images are far more deeply stored.<span id='_32DRVEbP'/>
- I remember when radio was being potentially disrupted by TV and a famous quote to promote the benefits of radio was doing the rounds:<span id='AfOAeGaBu'/>
- **‘Radio: Like TV, but the pictures are better.’**<span id='0Kx1EawAb'/>
- H- Well, it turns out that there’s a bunch of neuroscience supporting that idea now and consequently we are planning to get your imaginations really going in this series to take advantage of the way your brain naturally works.<span id='2wdKH89RQ'/>
- T- 4. What’s the easiest way to get top grades in the A level examinations?<span id='wLC1DU1Vl'/>
- H- The most effective way to study is to do lots of practice, but not just any kind of practice. You need to do what we’ve begun to refer to as ‘forensic practice.’<span id='41HhMsDQv'/>
- T - Forensic practice is an approach whereby your practice is inversely proportional to your competence.<span id='3XcG9Fhxc'/>
- T - In simple words, you spend most of your efforts on the things you know least and you dedicate little time to those areas in which you are already competent.<span id='TIsE7IhP6'/>
- H - This sounds straightforward and logical but most students don’t do this very well. At least not at a granular enough level of detail - not at a forensic level.<span id='W9M6fFsyX'/>
- T- So, here’s what you do:<span id='KLE3z5LGe'/>
- Step 1: Listen to these podcasts to get a good understanding of the [[Physics]].<span id='w6vY2WsrQ'/>
- Step 2: Create a clear visual representation of what’s going on, one that works well for you, that you will easily remember.<span id='48G_osSOj'/>
- H- Step 3: Do lots of past paper questions.<span id='x7vnkM6RT'/>
- T- Step 4: Analyse your answers and in particular, notice the discrepancy between what you’ve written and the ideal answers as detailed in the mark schemes and examiners reports.<span id='qy4WZqzsq'/>
- Step 5: Spend most of your time on the areas that you find hardest.<span id='IkYu9-cQ0'/>
- H- Step 6: Get top grades.<span id='quumagNZ2'/>
- T- izzittt...<span id='mK753pd_X'/>
- T- 5. What **Maths** am I going to need?<span id='eJs1-W-qe'/>
- H- The good news is that you’re not really going to need very much **Maths** at all. You’ll need to be able to remember a handful of equations, and you’ll need to know how to rearrange equations as well as derive a few equations from first principles.<span id='uf1qrvdes'/>
- T- But, as long as you have the ability to process rudimentary logic, you will be OK. There’s no calculus and there’s nothing particularly sophisticated. The logical processing of an average 10 year old will be enough to see you through, provided you are patient and you can follow steps.<span id='yCsG-QHxp'/>
- H- A B grade in GCSE **Maths** would probably be good enough, although being good at **Maths** definitely won’t harm you!<span id='KPAMpfPO7'/>
- However, there’s no escaping the fact that **Maths** is the language through which [[Physics]] models are tested and the sooner we come to terms with this and embrace the ‘utility’ of **Maths**, the easier it’s going to be for you to do well.<span id='auQoo0geL'/>
- T- 6. What topics are in the syllabus?<span id='xLx7bbvdq'/>
- H- Well broadly the topics break down into the following two areas:<span id='HWoiq2aIJ'/>
- Matter, energy and waves and<span id='WvRMQwNq6'/>
- **force**s and fields<span id='6p5CI-krt'/>
- T- Everything in the Universe comprises energy. Mass is a super-compacted form of energy as pronounced by Einstein in his most famous equation E = mc^2 ( E equals mc squared)<span id='5okBs58QI'/>
- H- Waves are just the way energy moves around.<span id='mtQthxnNj'/>
- T- To help us understand the way matter and energy interact and change forms, we create the concepts of **force**s and fields. A **force** is a construct which tells us how energy changes with position. A field is a construct that enables something to have a number associated with it through all space and time.<span id='7182xn7uy'/>
- H- Both these ideas are pretty abstract, but they are actually very helpful when generating testable predictions and as such they are key part of the world of [[Physics]].<span id='JD2bHOxHv'/>
- T- So, we hope you enjoy the series. Let’s get cracking.<span id='TO6rnihgN'/>
- END.<span id='SPgRxVzd5'/>
