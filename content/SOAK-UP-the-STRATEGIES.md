- [[The Learning Sprint]] Day 4<span id='TbQsWXm3C'/>
- Overview of Day 4: Soak up the Strategies<span id='Jvt3F4kwf'/>
    - Key Objectives<span id='epGxiubBr'/>
        - 1. SOLVE IT!<span id='2_CWf6SCv'/>
            - We use approaches like [[Reverse Learning]] and the [[Feynman Technique]] to spot, study and master the strategies used to solve the subject concepts when they appear in problem format. To detect, practice and master the procedures. To soak up the best strategies, to master the best ways to approach assessment and exam questions.<span id='gumkji8r5'/>
        - 2. TEACH IT!<span id='JCTfjTVOj'/>
            - Students use the **Teachback** technique to demonstrate their ability to solve any of the problems at the level of the subject covered in the sprint.<span id='D7zVggYDx'/>
    - Introduction<span id='48v7Xdf-4'/>
        - Problem-solving is where the rubber meets the road. OK, so you know the facts, and you can teach the concepts and how they all interrelate, but can you do the questions???<span id='LsQcnaAEN'/>
    - Background<span id='TCsgMui74'/>
        - Most of the Problem-Solving we require students to do at high school level will be routine. There won't be any lateral thinking leaps required and most of these approaches can be performed well by students of average cognitive function, provided the strategies are broken down into small enough chunks.<span id='WId_E2AWI'/>
        - If students have a good repertoire of facts and a decent appreciation of the concepts, a rudimentary understanding of mathematics will suffice in science all subjects apart from mathematics itself.<span id='0_vngWsUf'/>
    - Backdrop - general problem-solving methodology from Polya<span id='VAHKq2Xvo'/>
        - source https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf<span id='o2tBWuYUW'/>
        - Polya’s First Principle: Understand the problem<span id='rSZty3df0'/>
            - This seems so obvious that it is often not even mentioned, yet studens are often stymied in their efforts to solve problems simply because they don’t understand it fully, or even in part. Polya taught teachers to ask students questions such as:<span id='HT9zcKzPY'/>
                - Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?<span id='Gj6ArIqM7'/>
                - What are you asked to find or show?<span id='z2dI3Mh1u'/>
                - Can you restate the problem in your own words?<span id='u3PXHkwy5'/>
                - Can you think of a picture or diagram that might help you understand the problem?<span id='wvLwSZToZ'/>
                - Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?<span id='zkzJ7G3k2'/>
                - 1. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM<span id='Ssqxctq7G'/>

                  • First. You have to understand the problem.
                  • What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?
                  • Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition sufficient to determine the unknown? Or is it insufficient? Or redundant? Or contradictory?
                  • Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation.
                  • Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down?
        - Polya’s Second Principle: Devise a plan<span id='X4UhhYSTp'/>
            - Polya mentions that there are many reasonable ways to solve problems. The skill at choosing an appropriate strategy is best learned by solving many problems. You will find choosing a strategy increasingly easy. A partial list of strategies is included:<span id='-6KEM-O-s'/>
                - Guess and check<span id='z55Sf5d1K'/>
                - Look for a pattern<span id='fFLVHADFS'/>
                - Make an orderly list<span id='hHe-_vB0k'/>
                - Draw a picture<span id='IT9tMz-6c'/>
                - Eliminate possibilities<span id='t6SBhiwKD'/>
                - Solve a simpler problem<span id='ScjCPmUUT'/>
                - Use symmetry<span id='mOVTJcnYQ'/>
                - Use a model<span id='Uvd-XkqdY'/>
                - Consider special cases<span id='W9DFQeBBt'/>
                - Work backwards<span id='xjMcMG1MV'/>
                - Use direct reasoning<span id='qyHRkIJE7'/>
                - Use a formula<span id='wyRqvh1tl'/>
                - Solve an equation<span id='oQUFb4xcM'/>
                - Be ingenious<span id='C6LpS3ZU7'/>
            - 2. DEVISING A PLAN<span id='vj7KT3Uc3'/>

              • Second. Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found. You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution.
              • Have you seen it before? Or have you seen the same problem in a slightly different form?
              • Do you know a related problem? Do you know a theorem that could be useful?
              • Look at the unknown! Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or a similar unknown.
              • Here is a problem related to yours and solved before. Could you use it?
              Could you use its result? Could you use its method? Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make its use possible?
              • Could you restate the problem? Could you restate it still differently? Go back to definitions.
              • If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? A more general problem? A more special problem? An analogous problem? Could you solve a part of the problem? Keep only a part of the condition, drop the other part; how far is the unknown then determined, how can it vary?
              Could you derive something useful from the data? Could you think of other data appropriate to determine the unknown? Could you change the unknown or data, or both if necessary, so that the new unknown and the new data are nearer to each other?
              • Did you use all the data? Did you use the whole condition? Have you taken into account all essential notions involved in the problem?
        - Polya’s Third Principle: Carry out the plan<span id='Odud5mMRo'/>
            - This step is usually easier than devising the plan. In general, all you need is care and patience, given that you have the necessary skills. Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work discard it and choose another. Don’t be<span id='X1hhNP7be'/>

              misled, this is how mathematics is done, even by professionals.
            - 3. CARRYING OUT THE PLAN<span id='SXVQsVHMH'/>

              • Third. Carry out your plan.
              • Carrying out your plan of the solution, check each step. Can you see clearly
              that the step is correct? Can you prove that it is correct?
        - Polya’s Fourth Principle: Look back<span id='tkOcjmX3W'/>
            - Polya mentions that much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look<span id='BacgjfTyK'/>

              back at what you have done, what worked, and what didn’t. Doing this will enable
              you to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems.
            - 4. LOOKING BACK<span id='DK3x8fcyb'/>

              • Fourth. Examine the solution obtained.
              • Can you check the result? Can you check the argument?
              • Can you derive the solution differently? Can you see it at a glance?
              • Can you use the result, or the method, for some other problem?
