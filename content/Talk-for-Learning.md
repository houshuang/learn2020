    - Everybody knows that you only make real progress when learning a foreign language when you try to speak it.<span id='pRc2wn8a4'/>

    - This is because when you are talking, you are ’creating’ as you go along, from the repository of semantic chunks that you have stored in your memory.<span id='3PiT-R1hI'/>
    - Thus, when you talk about what you know, especially when you are explaining it to someone else, you arrive at a deep understanding of your topic as quickly as possible.<span id='tOSvi5DY0'/>
    - __It's the minimum will approach to learning.__<span id='liMMAF_qu'/>
- Richard Feynman popularised it with his Feynman Technique, and Einstein encapsulated it with this statement<span id='7nuEw31KK'/>
