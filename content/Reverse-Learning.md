- What is it?<span id='NgtgmPmEw'/>
- Reverse Learning is a [[deep learning]] strategy that starts with the solution and goes backwards step by step to the problem statement.<span id='gNw6s4lHp'/>
- Why is it useful?<span id='XgLs7M0qf'/>
- It provides greater insight into the problem solving strategy since the process demands deeper analytic and possibility thinking at each step.<span id='9jgTQOLfv'/>
- Origins<span id='haJOGq4k8'/>
    - I first learnt about the principle of working backwards when working with [[neurodiverse]] students. In particular I learnt the process of [[backward chaining]] which is an effective strategy when learning procedures.<span id='49FtLyPTW'/>
    - I then encountered the **PERT** project management technique and began to use this approach in all projects.<span id='RdL2mCfOj'/>
    - Finally, I began to apply it within teaching and borrowed heavily from Tom Miller’s excellent process documented here https://www.phyzzle.com/reverse-learning<span id='2pfXPKWak'/>

- The Reverse Learning Technique Checklist<span id='ed-zxuNKd'/>
- Step 1: Choose the right problem<span id='uE-I9meqI'/>
    - Identify a topic area you’re struggling with. ()In the case of the Learning Sprintof course we are covering all topics.)<span id='fUoAxSyQA'/>
    - Find 10 example problems, created by the [[Subject Expert]] which will have clear, fully worked solutions, that encompass these concepts well.<span id='eEQ6Zh9Cv'/>
- Step 2: Start asking “why” and “how”<span id='2MhR330Jx'/>
    - Start at the solution to the problem, and work your way back towards the question. Slowly and methodically work your way backwards, making sure you understand each detail and logical step required to get to the answer.<span id='-w_oPfC_J'/>
    - Ask things like “Why is this the answer?,” “How did she solve for that?,” “Why was this assumption made?,” etc. Write down these questions on the printout of the pdf of the solution as you go.<span id='b4wIdoda8'/>
    - Answer your own questions as you go along. Try to figure it out on your own from the knowns given in the the problem statement itself, or what you remember from your previous questions. If you’re still at a loss, then ask your team members for help or ideas. Usually by working collaboratively, you can resolve most of the challenges. If you’re not getting anywhere, reach out to the [[Sprint Master]] for suggestions. Often other student groups will be able to provide insight. If you really can’t get past a tricky bit, you can reach out to the [[Subject Expert]] for input.<span id='aRWhBa7Vp'/>
    - Write down your answers on the pdf as you come across them.<span id='_e0r2LLSJ'/>
- Step 3: Finish strong and review your work<span id='RId3Jak4G'/>
    - Keep pushing with the Q&A process until you get back to the problem statement, making sure you don’t leave any gaps in your understanding. Then take an overall look at the ground you’ve covered:<span id='aPqq7E1yn'/>
    - Which facts were not well known that caused any problems. Which concepts didn’t you understand before that now makes sense? Which leaps in logic seemed to be challenging? Which leaps seemed obvious? What surprised you? What insights can you pull out of your work? What’s the learning you can take into your next problem?<span id='aJFyQP_2Q'/>
    - For the learner, the most important part of the work is to look back at the completed solution. Surveying the course of their work and the final shape of the solution, they may find an unending variety of things to<span id='IY2va4257'/>

      observe.
    - They may meditate upon the difficulty of the problem and about the decisive idea; they may try to see what hampered them and what helped them finally.<span id='SDOqUzMJ2'/>
    - They may look out for simple intuitive ideas: Can you see it at a glance?<span id='jHqpkJoau'/>
    - They may compare and develop various methods: Can you derive the result differently?<span id='LohTkqwyS'/>
    - They may try to clarify their present problem by comparing it to problems formerly solved; they may try to invent new problems which they can solve on the basis of their just completed work: Can you use the result, or the<span id='QPEb7wDD1'/>

      method, for some other problem?
    - Digesting the problems they solved as completely as they can, they may<span id='UnTGSiBRe'/>

      acquire well ordered knowledge, ready to use.
