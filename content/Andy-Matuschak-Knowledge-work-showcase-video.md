- about **John Seely Brown**, **Design Unbound** and **Insight through making** about **design**
- starts a daily note, hierarchical bullets but also normal text. Making new pages and clicking on them. **Bear**
- taking notes from the book - not clear if he has already taken notes while reading the book, or if he is just talking from memory and flipping through the book while taking notes
- Initially adding a bunch of concepts, and then indenting under, saying "I will separate these out into different notes later"
- [[types of **reasoning**]] / thinking
    - **synthetic**
        - **syntopic**
    - **abductive**
        - **Abductive** reasoning (also called abduction, **abductive** inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference that starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations. #**Occam's razor**? **designerly thinking**?
        - Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of **Bayesian priors**
            - This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it - **inference to the best explanation**
            - What is abductive reasoning? [[**interval**::5.0]] [[**factor**::2.65]] **May 11th, 2020**
                - **Abductive** reasoning (also called abduction, **abductive** inference, or retroduction) is a form of logical inference that starts with an observation or set of observations and then seeks to find the simplest and most likely conclusion from the observations. #**Occam's razor**? **designerly thinking**?
            - How is deductive and abductive reasoning different? [[**interval**::5.0]] [[**factor**::2.50]] **May 8th, 2020**
                - a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion
                - This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it - **inference to the best explanation**
    - **inductive**
    - **Deductive**
        - a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion
- curious about how Andy thinks about **mapping**, would any of this thinking have been better done visually?
- creates a note for the book, literature note
    - not evergreen, jumping off point, gets bibliography metadata from Zotero (manually)
        - wonder if he automatically pulls in these for citations
    - named autors comma title
    - writes short summary - not copying from his daily note. Grounds his thinking, provides feedback about how well he understands the bookj.
- coinage-oriented note, named after the authors - doesn't like this, means he hasn't properly digested it yet. Not sure if this concept has transcended the book yet (in wider usage)
    - trying to put it in his own words, instead of copying
- Example of using search, and working across a large number of notes
