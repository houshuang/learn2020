- What is it<span id='iqxLpeEBS'/>
    - It's a method of summarising notes at repeated intervals, getting increasingly concise on each pass as you distil the essence of the content<span id='FQGY0c1nW'/>
- Why is it useful?<span id='KLNlYfxbN'/>
    - It's a way to get a deeper understanding of content over time<span id='zNz6Eieb_'/>
- How does it work?<span id='aW0W2hRDr'/>
    - There are many ways to do it, but the idea is that you start with a lot of information in an extended format (like a book) and you end up with a single view of the most important/interesting/relevant information for your purposes (like a diagram, a sketch, a paragraph, a sentence, a meme, a quotable phrase, an action statement)<span id='TO9YjoWs4'/>

            - The idea of progressive summarization is to create notes such that their purpose is comprehensible in the future.<span id='uovb_d4eQ'/>
            - **Layer 1** When you encounter something interesting, capture it<span id='gvNSj4hBa'/>
            - **Layer 2** Bold the most interesting parts<span id='SKE429Xua'/>
            - **Layer 3** Highlight the most interesting bolded sections<span id='pXUWDeIgR'/>
            - **Layer 4** Summarize the bolded portions and the note in your own words<span id='PQmRohGrB'/>
            - **Layer 5** Turn your notes into something new: a tweet, a blog post, even a book<span id='3kAy-W48n'/>
