title: "E: Learning platform for independent course creators"
---

- #E #p #public
- People use **Skillshare** or **Teachable** for things like **roam-course**s
- ^^Why are people able to command such a premium for such courses, especially if they are mainly collections of videos?^^
- Basically just a Youtube playlist with payment/accounts? Why doesn't **Youtube** offer this?
- Others, like **Write of passage** and **BASB-course** use a custom stack - payment, membership, Zoom, mailing lists etc?
- None of the MOOC providers (Course, EdX, Udacity) want to work with individuals (also not Minerva currently)
- Things people want
    - easy set up, payment, promotion etc
    - white label - not "one more course on X platform", but "awesomecourse.com"
    - hosting video and curriculum (mostly video)
    - mailing lists / discussion forums
    - cohort functionality
- One possibility would be for someone to use **OpenEdX** to set up a **Software-as-a-Service** for independent course creators, with payment etc integrated (**Stripe**?)
    - Authoring courses is a hassle, not sure it's worth it, given the small numbers.
    - Maybe something like Canvas?
- Some of these courses also offer live video (Zoom etc) - what would it look like for Minerva to offer our services? Ideally through a reseller who could offer all of the other functionality, and bundle Forum access and training with payment, discussion forums, promotion, etc...
- Examples:
    - **Nat Eliason** has made $50,000 on a course on Roam Research which is basically just 20 short videos (95$ fee).
    - **Tiago Forte** has taught 800 people on his Building a Second Brain course, minimum price is 999$.
    - ^^Other examples - how big a market is this, and how many would be interested in Teachables-style courses or a bit more interactive, versus full-on video etc?^^
