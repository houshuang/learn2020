- [[Advanced Physics Podcast Series]]<span id='8ZqqXf32Q'/>
- In the last episode we talked about scalars and vectors and we introduced the concepts of the **Displacement** and the **Velocity** of an object, as the rate of change of the object’s **Displacement**.<span id='ZGLpFhDmD'/>
- In this one we are going to move on to consider how the **Velocity** itself changes. We are going to end up by coming up with a formal way of talking about the rate of change of **Velocity** of an object.<span id='31XBq3izN'/>
- So let’s get cracking…<span id='3cKL5Qt6j'/>
- H - Remeber, we posed the question: ‘Does the golf ball stay at the same **Velocity** for its entire journey, or does the **Velocity** change along the journey, and if so, by how much?<span id='MYpt_0ngm'/>
- T - Well, we reasoned that since the ball eventually stopped, it must have changed its **Velocity** from ‘some value’ to ‘zero’, so we worked out that its **Velocity** must have changed.<span id='dBCgMQV3l'/>
- H - Exactly. The neat thing now is that we can just do exactly the same thing to see how its **Velocity** changes as we did when we were looking to see how its **Displacement** changes.<span id='1xpKfUe2R'/>
- T - Go on.<span id='yqRCmClBJ'/>
- H - Well, we worked out the **Velocity** as the rate of change of **Displacement** by measuring the position at one point in time and then measuring the position again at a slightly later point.<span id='Wsp8OIq8a'/>
- T - yep, I’m with you.<span id='EXvnBjT5W'/>
- H - Well, we can just measure **Velocity** at one point, and then shortly after, we can measure the **Velocity** again. We can then divide this change in **Velocity** by the time taken for the change and we have an idea of how quickly the **Velocity** of the object is changing.<span id='oV1KEEu6z'/>
- T - Now the ‘rate of change of **Velocity**’ is a bit of a mouthful, but luckily it has a name, and that name is the ‘**Acceleration**’ of the object.<span id='2pPUWJLSU'/>
- H - The ****Acceleration**** of an object is a measure of how quickly its **Velocity** is changing and it is actually a very useful concept for physicists, since changing the **Velocity** of an object is something that we are often trying to do. More of that later on in the series, when we move onto dynamics.<span id='uqlIA6hBO'/>
- The formal definition of the **Acceleration** is as follows:<span id='GwhrSzB7T'/>
- __The **Acceleration** of an object is equal to the change in **Velocity** of the object divided by the time taken for this change.__<span id='SGkibS_ib'/>
- T - Or the **Acceleration** of an object is equal to the object’s rate of change of **Velocity**.<span id='Z77Q6ywkV'/>
- H - At this point we should probably bring in Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.<span id='_pC-DeRGI'/>
- T - Really? You’re going to go there now? Are these guys ready for it?<span id='kny12F8qj'/>
- H - I think they are. And you know the best way to talk about Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is through a joke.<span id='55ssWP08i'/>
- T - Awesome. Go on…<span id='GR5eHkjU_'/>
- H - So, Werner Heisenberg was stopped by the police for speeding in his car. (Going way over the limit)<span id='2JNdKMm0G'/>
- The police officer approached him accusingly:<span id='VqMeMG4oG'/>
- ‘Excuse me sir, have you any idea how fast you were going?’<span id='3_IuVFo8k'/>
- Heisenberg replied: ‘I’m afraid not. But I knew exactly where I was.’<span id='enzkuyOV7'/>
- T - Ha ha. Nice one. Of course, that means a lot more to us than it will to the listeners. Why don’t you explain a little about Heisenberg’s ideas?<span id='SLtxt2YZ9'/>
- H - Heisenberg was a pretty smart guy and he realised that there was a conundrum when measuring **Velocity**.<span id='CpEfLotWe'/>
- T - What exactly did he spot?<span id='L7w8WI2_l'/>
- H - OK, let’s go. First of all, I might use the words speed and distance because it’s easier to process mentally… (As long as we are just considering a single direction, then this explanation is valid)<span id='yq4WXLsN1'/>
- So, an object’s speed is how far it moves in a certain time. But in order to measure how far it moves you have to accurately know where it started and then know where it ended up.<span id='RwMbq9nXT'/>
- T - Can we use an example?<span id='PSxRntdKZ'/>
- H - Of course. Let’s say you’re on a train platform, watching a non-stop train go through the station.<span id='RxU5Dm7EG'/>
- You start your stopwatch when the front of the train goes by and you stop it when the rear of the train goes by. Your stopwatch reads 1.2 seconds exactly.<span id='wLBPWmyKJ'/>
- You know the length of the train is 90 metres, (from your pamphlet on UK Train lengths, shape and sizes - 1981-2016) and so you can calculate the train’s **Velocity** as 90 metres divided by 1.2 seconds, which equals 75 metres per second.<span id='6sACPS7CN'/>
- T - Great, so there doesn’t appear to be a problem does there?<span id='Fp81fzGlA'/>
- H - Well, it turns out that there is a problem. Where was the train when it was travelling at 75 metres per second?<span id='3eTiHe-f9'/>
- T - What do you mean?<span id='ZZSbYRgI9'/>
- H - Well, where **EXACTLY** was the train, when it was traveling at this **Velocity**? Because you measured the front of the train as it passed you and then the rear of the train as it passed you. So the ‘train’ was actually in two different places when it was measured as having a **Velocity** of 75 metres per second.<span id='dUnWTDjGb'/>
- T - I don’t completely follow.<span id='pRfXD-0T3'/>
- H - Well, all it means is that we can’t know exactly where the train is when we measure its **Velocity**, because the **Velocity** **Measurement** requires that the train is measured between two different positions!<span id='fn2coz9Uw'/>
- T - **Velocity** only makes sense ‘between two different positions’ so an object’s **exact** ****Velocity**** at an **exact** **position** has no meaning.<span id='0lDAbDsYQ'/>
- H - In practical terms, we are always thinking of measuring the average **Velocity** of an object between two points, even if these points are extremely close together. They are still different points.<span id='jREE86SMw'/>
- T - Fascinating.<span id='m6X0i9V5T'/>
- Anyway, ‘let’s get back to how the **Velocity** of the golf-ball is changing through its journey and the implications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.<span id='6eN1uGiJv'/>
- H - Well, remember when I said that all we need to do to work out the **Acceleration** of the golf-ball is to measure its **Velocity** at one point of its journey and then a short time later, measure it again?<span id='3yJHZajn4'/>
- T - Yep, in order to see how the **Velocity** of the ball is changing. Yes, I remember.<span id='gsrT1b8hr'/>
- H - Well, the uncertainty principle states that you can’t measure the exact **Velocity** at an exact position. So, since we can’t know the exact **Velocity** at a specific position, how can we measure the change in **Velocity** between two points of the golf-ball’s journey?<span id='Wm3VtMVZZ'/>
- T - Yes, I see that we may have a problem, Houston.<span id='eoI1kJAp2'/>
- Well, the trick is to use averages.<span id='LKyWYz-nO'/>
- In fact, all we are ever really doing is comparing the ball’s average **Velocity** over a short region at  one point of its journey with its average **Velocity** over a short region at a later point on the ball’s journey.<span id='l0xJvLMYJ'/>
- T - That sounds really confusing.<span id='2BRwb-3j8'/>
- H - Well it is and it isn’t. Remembering that Physicists are really only ever interested in the MEANINGFULNESS of **Measurement**s and so, provided things are moving at relatively low velocities compared with the **Velocity** of light (300,000 kilometres per second) you find that the uncertainty principle doesn’t really catch us out.<span id='HiUh7xfdd'/>
- T - But when you make **Measurement**s involving photons of light etc, I guess it does cause problems?<span id='8RADwJwXf'/>
- H - Absolutely. But we can discuss that in another session!<span id='RpUZ0kYks'/>
- T - Great stuff. We’ll move on to discuss how we do calculations with all these good ideas in part 3 of this Unit…<span id='4ZUNDnfc1'/>
- H - Yep, we move onto something called the **SUVAT** equations, and they’re a barrel load of fun!<span id='DDRpA6ICh'/>
- T - Can’t wait...<span id='8i8rNalxA'/>
