- Overview of Day 5: Test for Truth<span id='UdrGCiiiX'/>
- Key Objectives<span id='zqRatRiQO'/>
    - 1. PROVE IT!<span id='1dAZr9YLI'/>
        - We bring it all together and teach students how to deliver the exam performance of the olympic athlete. To demonstrate their competence, to prove learners can apply their understanding in the relevant context.<span id='x3bQTz-gg'/>
    - 2. PUBLISH IT!<span id='c35mMlvui'/>
        - The acid test of students' understanding is the quality of the materials they produce to demonstrate their competence. If these products are high enough quality to be considered valuable to others, outside the context of the sprint, then we will have considered our job to have been well done.<span id='B_48QGwlH'/>
