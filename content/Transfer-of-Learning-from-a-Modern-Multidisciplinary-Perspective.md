- Introduction
    - Transfer is a term that describes a situation where information learned at one point in time influences performance on information encountered at a later point in time.
    - **Harald Høffding** (1892)
        - learning event `A`
        - stored internal representation when learned `a`
        - internal representation of response to learned event `b`
        - observable response `B`
        - chain `A-a-b-B`
            - event `A` triggers `a` leads to `B`
        - what if you encounter `A'`? Will it still trigger `a`? How likely?
            - ^^Isn't it also about how `b` can be applied in a different way to a slightly different problem? You wouldn't want an identical response? #q^^
        - Ideal
            - one learned event facilitates further learning
            - extend the range of events to which learned material can be applied
    - **Types of transfer**
        - **Specific transfer**, **Near transfer** and **Literal Transfer** are similar
        - [[**Lateral Transfer** and **Vertical Transfer** distinction]] made by **Robert M. Gagné**
            - **Lateral Transfer**
                - skill or knowledge influences more complex skill or knowledge later - precursor
                - instruction should be arranged to take advantage of hierarchical structure of knowledge to be learnt
                    - part of movement of
                    - **task analysis**
                        - begin with [[terminal **learning goals**]]
                        - move backwards until you encountered **entering behaviours**
                            - skills students had acquired before entering school
                    - **mastery learning**
            - **Vertical Transfer**
                - "generalization that spreads over a broad set of situations at roughly the same level of complexity"n
                - not well defined
        - [[**Specific transfer** and **Nonspecific transfer** distinction]]
            - **Specific transfer**
                - clear similarity between stimulus complex in situation A and B
            - **Nonspecific transfer**
                - no obvious relationship, but acquisition of one influences the acquisition of the other
                    - for example **learning to learn** (monkey experiments)
                    - poorly defined
        - [[**Near transfer** and **Far transfer** distinction]]
            - Introduced by **Richard E. Mayer**
                - level of similarity between conditions of original learning and in transfer learning (^^how is this different from **Specific transfer**?^^)
            - **James M. Royer**
                - **school-learned events** and **out-of-school events** - applying something learnt at school in an out-of-school context is far transfer
            - very difficult to define
            - early thought: the far extreme of **stimulus generalization gradient** that will still activate a learned response
            - category of real-world problems that could be solved through use of a mathematical operation like multiplication
        - [[**Literal Transfer** and **Figural Transfer** distinction]] by **James M. Royer**
            - **Literal Transfer**
                - application of an intact bit of knowledge to a new learning event
                    - example: calculating the area of a rectangle can be applied to determining size of a rug for a room
            - **Figural Transfer**
                - involving application of a segment of **world knowledge** as a tool for thinking about or learning about a new problem
                    - **Metaphors** like "Encyclopaedias are gold mines"
                - definition by example, and not very clear
        - **Actor-oriented transfer**

- First chapter by **Daniel Schwartz**, **John Bransford** and **David Sears**
    - classic views of transfer measures transfer in ways that make people look dumb
        - measure what is "transferred out" (whether people directly apply what they learned in one context to another), and not what is "transferred in"
        - follow "sequestered problem-solving" paradigm, participants tested isolated from "contaminating" influences of information (colleagues, text, electronic resources)
    - propose expanded definition of transfer: preparation for future learning (things you learnt help you learn new things more effectively) ^^pro-pedeutic?^^
        - transfer is not as rare as previously assumed
    - two-dimensional space of innovation and efficiency
- Second chapter by **Christopher Wolfe**, **Valerie Reyna**, **Charles Brainerd**
    - implications of **fuzzy trace theory** for transfer
        - **dual-process** [[theory of **memory**]]
            - explain surprising findings about relation between memory and cognitive processes
            - two independent **memory systems**
                - formed in parallel, but encoded and stored separately
                - gist
                    - used to reason and problem solve
                    - nebulous patterns
                    - underlying meanings and patterns
                    - **more important for transfer**
                - verbatim
                    - used to answer questions about literal representations of knowledgesur
                    - face details
- Third chapter by **David Hammer**, **Andrew Elby**, **Rachel Scherr** and **Edward Redish**
    - transfer as a concept is not useful.
        - traditionally describes knowledge as unitary entity - learn in one context and apply in another
    - propose a **manifold ontology**
        - fine-grained resources that may or may not be activated by an individual in response to a context
        - **learning** is a cognitive state in which several resources in the student's memory are activated and applied to deal with context under consideration
            - not as acquisition or formation of a cognitive object
- Fourth chapter by **Andrea diSessa** and **Joseph Wagner**
    - view of knowledge as a complex system containing many kinds of elements and structures
        - perspective of **coordination classes**
            - a model of concepts as complex systems, and the principal function of the concept/system is to allow people read specific kinds of information out of situations in the world
            - possessing a scientific concept and applying it flexibly means
                - ability to coordinate large numbers of knowledge elements in various ways that accommodate wide range of contexts over which concept is applicable
    - measure of transfer
        - ability to apply knowledge flexibly across varying contexts
    - **Types of transfer**
        - **Expert-like transfer**
            - ability to compile appropriate knowledge reliably for application in specific contexts (**concept projections**)
        - Novices **concept projections** are extremely sensitive to context, and often result in unsuccessful performance.
    - Necessary research
        - Investigations that assess not just performance, but type of knowledge used by novices in early work in domain they are learning.
