I want you to think about the experience I had in just producing the 240 houses in the early '20's-1922. I had 5 factories going and I invented my own machinery for making those fibrous blocks. It was interesting that the day after I talked about the fibrous blocks, somebody called my attention to the fact that the room outside here in the studio is lined with the material that I produced, and that the company as I finished it up and sold it out to, the Celotex Company for what they called Soundex, and it is still really the best sound absorption material you can get.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"FN_foWaSv\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Now, I had invented the machinery for mixing this, it was machinery I had to have something where I did not take a heavy cementing material and just clot it together with these fibers, and when we had found then that the wood excelsior was best, I tried all kinds of things seaweed from the Sargasso sea, all kinds of dried grass and things, but nothing really worked quite so well as actually shredded shredded wood deliberately shredded wood. It was something that could be manufactured quite rapidly too. So, the idea was then to make a block that was really light weight it was like a felt hat, and so for what I had developed was the means of I learned how to do it, by just taking a pitch fork and putting this wet cement on it, so it looked like more or less milk and cream on there, and taking pitchforks with a number of guys and continually pulling it through the way you'd pull spaghetti out of a bunch, and keep spinning and throwing it up in the air, and gradually you spread the material over all of the fibers. I had to have invent a machine that would spread spread this liquid very thinly, but enough to also saturate it, to beat it, so that I developed a great tumbling drum, and this was before we had the cement tumblers that you see going along the highways. In fact, they came out of this particular invention where I then had developed a way of having a gear wheel on the outside of my drum, and driving it around. And driving it around fast enough that the material tumbled, it went out like a wave on the beach cresting throwing it over. And I moved it at a speed where it would crest over, and then I had a shaft going down through the center of it, with a great steel tongs on it, very much like the pitch fork, but just being a shaft, so the head of one was over the end of the other the base of the other, so the fibers could never get in onto the shaft and wind up on the shaft.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"CV7r6fsVa\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"And, then, I was able to introduce the unbailed excelsior and the liquid at the front end, and this whole thing was slanted, and it would start cresting over and landing on the forks and being thrown into enormous.

It was the largest moving picture that has ever been conceived of, the biggest scenario ever conceived of, and to make that really work was to me it is incredible that a little human being could get up a world operation of that size, particularly in the years when he did this we didn't have, the radio wasn't going and all kinds of things you and I would like to have going yesterday was the Morse Code that's where you do S.O.S., so there was a tapping out of that, but there was no voice, like that, and we didn't have the telephone lines extended as they are, and much was done by telegraph.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"zubz5zqP2\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"At any rate, he set up this and this brought about incredible change in the world pattern, because I have given you cities, and how cities began, and how the land owner the great baron said you must come inside the walls here, and they stored things in there.

And warehouses are gone altogether now. They are only for furniture and things like that, but big corporations no corporations every corporation that followed him found that they lost enormous amounts of money through warehousing they must not do it. So they all took on his time control study. Now, this changed cities very much when you gave up the warehouses.

He said if we get down to fine enough tolerances, we'll be able to have interchangeable parts. This brought him into, he fostered, there were some Swedish tool gauge makers very extraordinary gauges, and they, these men had learned how you making very special lathes, how they could control things to ten thousandths of an inch to one hundred thousandth of an inch and so forth where gauge blocks and so forth Henry fostered that whole development of those Swedish men, so he could really then, setting up his tools, with calipers with incredibly fine dimensions. These are not things that you and I can do with our eye I don't know if you have ever tried this out on drafting but you have in your engineer's scale fiftieth of an inch usually, there are some with a hundredth of an inch but, the human eye could not really differentiate, beyond there it just gets blurred it gets into the gray.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"ywfnQXrVz\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"So when we get into offset when you get into printing you can then have little points of color printing with just these tiny little points and getting to Benday screens and so forth, down to 200 and so forth, looks like absolutely complete beautiful continuous color.

So that there is a limit as to how far the human eye can differentiate intervals, and that is just about one hundredth of an inch, so when you begin to get into ten thousandths of an inch, and hundred thousandths of an inch incidentally, in the controls today, I mentioned to you the other day, we had gotten up to one ten millionth of an inch in some of the modern aerospace technology.

They bought a lot of tools, and they had they got 30,000 orders and l5,000 orders, and that looks like a lot of orders, doesn't it? They said, I'm going to make some money out of that. At any rate, people on Wall Street all began betting on automobile companies. Boy, this is a brand new one. So all American began to bet on it. So a lot of shares are sold, and a lot of automobile companies are all going bust. And that got to be a very sorry turn of affairs, so they there was complex of them that got sold primarily there was the Dodge car, the Dodge group. And they were in real trouble, so there is a banking firm in New York, Dillon-Reed at the time, and they, then, put together a group of the bankrupt firms, because Dillon-Reed had some design science, and some engineers really making some studies, and they found that there were really you could only have one premium car, where people would pay anything a rich man so it was a Rolls Royce, and Americans couldn't really break through on that one.

So there was then this enormous capital cost then at the outset.

Out of the 3 tons, a very large part of that is about 2 tons is steel. And once you get mass purchasing of steel, by the time you buy 100 cars, the price does not go down any more, so there is really a fixed price for production steel. So therefore you find that the car, as designed, has a base price per pound, so much steel, so much glass, whatever it may be the early ones didn't have much glass.

You must really know that strength. You are dealing in everything is strength/weight ratios, and in the air world where you're getting up there in the sky the stress is going to occur. You've got to know just what you're doing.

Furthermore, the engineers had then been told that as you rolled a sheet of aluminum, and at the edge of the rollers there was a completely different pressure from the middle of the area, so you must only use the middle of the area, so they were cutting anything they were going to produce, they would specify that it had to be cut out of the heart of the sheet. The amount of scrap was very great. It got to the point where in car loadings and backlog of cars needed, almost three times as many cars were being used to take scrap away from factories as taking fresh materials to them.

And sheet metal workers, by the way, are, at my Bridgeport plant when I was producing my car, that was an aluminum body. That aluminum body is hammered out of sheet aluminum. It is possible to hammer steel or aluminum sheet and make it into curvature. You start hammering here and you start stretching it here just keep spreading out a little. These men don't know it, but what happens is they are pushing atoms around because the atoms have critical proximity one with another, you can push them around and they still hold onto the other atoms, so one of the things that really surprised me and I really got into working metals that you can take metal and \\\"gather\\\" it, you can start with a sheet and make it dump into a chunk, or you can spread it out.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"VPPaDK3tz\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Now, the atoms could roll around on one another to get stacked up or to be thinned out again.

Somehow or other the Poles have very special metal work, and my hammer man, all the hammer men were Poles. And this became, we can find, from the old armor making came through ages of making the breast plates and things like that. They were the great experts the Polish craftsmen. I found that this was really a very interesting thing, as I began to know my industry, and do prototyping work. After the time I built my car in Bridgeport all those tool men and metal workers all moved west because they were needed in prototyping of research in Detroit got a lot, and they went even further into California they went wherever the airplane companies were, but a certain amount were used in Detroit.

And I needed to have some sheet metal work done later on, which we will come to my bathroom, because I wanted then to develop prototypes in copper sheet, and copper sheet is particularly good because, steel will get harder and harder and more difficult to anneal. Copper you can anneal it if you just keep working and working it, just a little bit of heat and it goes practically back into jelly form, and it just never gets tired. Many of the other metals get tired, and they build up a fatigue, and after you've worked them enough they are going to just crack apart. But copper would not do it, so it was a particularly good metal for doing prototyping work, if you wanted to get something shaped out, or maybe if you were going to produce it in plastic or something, but for your main shaping copper is ideal. So I did develop my first mass production bathroom in copper sheet. But I had to go to Detroit for hammer men, whereas there were available in Carbon in Bridgeport Connecticut in the '30's.

And we can have then a tool such as was developed in the making of the razor blades the Gillette Company found they could take sheet, continuous strip metal and they could keep running it through, sharpening it at both edges, so it was a continuous thing, and then chop it into separate pieces, and when they chopped it into separate pieces they needed to do more honing and things like that, so that they then developed the mass production the little pneumatic cups, little tiny tubes that just sucked, that kept picking this thing out of the machines and so forth, so that they saw they could take the machine that would pick up the piece of metal, and with x-ray diffraction know exactly how to orient it to put it into the machine the right way.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"uFa2ucDcp\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"There was not a single thing that Glenn Martin and his engineers could say to me, that were reasons that Detroit could never get into mass production of airplanes, that they couldn't find a scientist that would give them some trick that could be played that would make it possible.

So, they tooled up for it, and the kind of planes, then, that the United States was making, to go to Europe to go for our armed forces, that we were then training our armed forces and so forth, and we were going to have to fly these things in Europe. So much was being learned by the Germans and the English in the evolution of the plane was so very rapid, that these planes that were being made in the United States became absolutely obsolete. So they developed in America Detroit would say \\\"we'll take care of that, we'll just have a modification line,\\\" so they'd build a second production line and the minute that plane was finished, they brought it up to the head of the production line and it got all rebuilt again. Then by the time they got to England they still were out of date, so in England they set up a new production, the re-modification plant again. And then by the time they literally got into the war, when the Americans came then and did their first bombing strikes and so forth, so many planes were lost that it was absolutely lethal to fly the damn things. And so Detroit said, \\\"that's alright we're just going to we absolutely out-produce those people anyway, so planes are going to get lost, so we'll just out-produce them. Well, at this point, American mothers began to get to the American Congressmen and said \\\"We can't out-produce the kids.\\\"\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"ZQ3tm8-vX\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"And the Congress, then, suddenly began to become really alarmed at the rate of the killings, and if we were not really ending this there was going to be incredible slaughter. So they simply said to the Air Force, well what should we do. We have been forcing you all the time. So the Air Force said, they found that the contracts had been made the lawyers and people who had worked to get all these contracts for Detroit, there were so many contracts that were so absolutely unbreakable, and all the lawyers by this time were busy on other kinds of war problems, nobody could undo them, so they just simply let Detroit keep manufacturing this junk, and about a quarter of the Air Force, it was said, just to fly them out to the Kansas fields and let them stand there.

And Wichita, Kansas had fourteen aircraft plants, and had them there for a very long time, and they had fourteen air fields. And so they were well known names like Beech and Cessna and so forth, and the Boeing Number Two was there and so forth.

One million change orders were written! This was quite a change in industry where you can have a million change orders against one and you're going to fire everybody. This was a very abrupt thing, so that everything that we had inherited, the British were finally able to get America to come in, we were able to inherit an enormous amount of information on the information the intelligence information, what the tools were that the German's were using, and what the English were able to tell us themselves. So that what we did was, at that point, industry was designed to accommodate change. This is a fantastically important point, economically. I know, our American society doesn't know it, World decided it. You really have to be in there in that kind of a game to realize, and also to be as old as I was, to see complete change. Now I saw that change starting, and all these things I am talking about are DESIGN SCIENCE. I saw this changing when I came into Phelps Dodge as Assistant Director in the Research Department after finishing doing my cars. After I finished doing the cars in Bridgeport, I then wrote Nine Chains to the Moon and I was still writing Nine Chains to the Moon when I went into the Phelps Dodge as Assistant Director of Research. I had mentioned to you that in W.W.I, was the first World War, because in dealing with these metals rather than in the vegetation. It was a very different world, and it was to do then with the alloys and particularly then, inanimate energy, waterfalls and so forth, and the ability to generate power and to bring it from here to there by copper. And I mentioned several times now that in one year, 1917, we produced, mined, and refined and put to work more copper in one year than cumulatively had been produced by all of humanity in the whole history of man before. So that copper then being produced this way was very highly feasible due to two inventions that had occurred just before W.W.I. One was FLOTATION and the other one was ELECTROLYTIC REFINING OF COPPER. Flotation made it possible to very quickly refine, and the refining then by electrolysis and depositing the pure copper over here, very great but you had to have a lot of energy for it obviously.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"jeNSdfL7n\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"PART 8\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"AJ9u8oQhe\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"These reduced the costs of copper production incredibly, to such an extent, it happens that copper and gold and silver tend to co-occur, and sometimes in the early times you didn't know if you had a copper mine, or a gold mine, or a silver mine. But the amount of copper and silver is very much less plentiful than is the amount of the gold and silver, but it is usually there, so the copper companies are also in the gold and silver business, and so Phelps Dodge had a very important gold business, and they found that at the time of W.W.I, I say, then found the cost of production had been so low by electrolytic of refining and by flotation, that what the Phelps Dodge, and the other company big copper companies were getting for gold as they sold it to the government for mints. The price of the gold paid for the complete mining and refining of copper. So they wouldn't take it out of the ground unless they were going to get a lot of money for it. This was absolutely free to take it out, refine it and sell it. Boy, this is a great one to find. That relatively small amount, so they kept taking the gold out and have your copper is there, but take your copper out when you're going to make money. And war time is when you make money. So when that war did come on they really did want to take it out, and they could, as I said, because they had these new production capabilities. But, the copper companies like everybody else, had also made a few types of parts that is wire, pipe and so forth, and they sold and sheet and they sold to fabricators.

So you will just be in the sales department. Well, we had, I have given you then, also up to the Great Crash which I have talked to you about, and then the laying down of the hands of the banks finally they just simply had been loaning people's deposits, they didn't have it wasn't their money at all. We also then find the great power of J.P. Morgan. And J.P. Morgan had, and everything that was really big in America, there were all the prime contracts of every kind, like whether it was General Motors or U.S. Steel, they had two or three members on the Board and they were absolutely able to control all of those companies.

They ran it separately from their mining company. Phelps Dodge Mining and Phelps Dodge Copper Products. And the salesmen-managers of that company, now you were in the Depression and one of the big things was to sell copper, so the salesman found that it was his market, and the President of the company was a mining man, a mining engineer, very fine man incidentally, and Louis Case, and he is the one who had the Research Department take me on to make studies make forward studies of the industrialization of the World to see what part that copper would be playing in the future years.

Went back to every monograph The Bureau of Mines anything I could find out, the whole history of copper. I found historically how there had been a time when Spain was the greatest copper miner and so forth, and it played a great deal in the fastenings of their ships and whatever it might be, and how all the copper that had ever been produced by man, it was expensive, it was used functionally because it was plentiful enough to be used functionally; but the minute they could get a substitute for it they always put it in, if something could cost less. So they began to learn then to get steel, that is a use a any kind of steel fastener where you could find some way to keep it from rusting, then it would take the place of the copper. So I found that copper had been in ships of the early great big ships, that were really able to go around the world, copper played a very big part, and as fast as they could get less expensive metals to put in they continually took out the copper. Copper was used, because you could also melt it up under the annealing condition I spoke to you about was, it had all kinds of uses, and countries that were going to go to war always found they needed copper. And one of the great tricks historically, of copper was to put copper into bronze great statues of the heroes, and the kings. This was a way in which a country could start importing copper without anyone really realizing it. They were just putting up statues of famous people. So it was part of the great war strategy game to have a lot of statues that could be melted up when the war came.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"okdSoaiPT\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Now, the, what I found was, in Phelps Dodge, the Sales Department beginning to annoying the mining group, and they were sort of taking things over because they needed to make sales, and sales were being very difficult because something was happening that bothered everybody and it had never been in the copper industry before. There was scrap copper around, obviously there was enormous production in W.W.I, you should expect some scrap around, but it had always been assumed that scrap was something that you just had for a little while, and then you used it up, and that was the end of that. There was very much the attitude there was in the Club of Rome Report, the Meadows Report on the limits of growth and so forth a couple of years ago, where I found that the economists who did that report were not metallurgists, they didn't know anything about their mining world or production engineering, and they were assuming that the metals were something that gets consumed, just like strawberries.

So even the time that I was in there, I suddenly found that 84% of all the copper in the world that had ever been mined was still in use, we knew where it was, it had been melted out time and again from this use and put into another. And it had drifted from making possible the Marine building, it had drifted out of there and then got into the railroading, because there were a lot of things, you didn't want anything to rust, it would be very dangerous, the coupling of those cars and so forth, so a great deal was done in brass. Then as fast as they could afford to they substituted steel, and the copper was melted out of there, and then it came into this extraordinary new telephone game in electronics in a very big way.

So they no longer they didn't monopolize the copper market at all, so their monopoly was broken, and this was very, of great concern to them. So everybody is worried about scrap I found, and nobody seemed to know what to say about it, so I made some studies for them, and I really went exhaustively into what I am saying, because what I did, then, because I am a mechanic I really got into the different classes of manufacture different classes of goods altogether, and I found And incidentally, the metals records, I assure you are very extraordinary. There is so much money is involved, that the numbers of agencies that are reporting accurately on metals down in Wall Street are incredible. And so there are a number of associations, and so what is it, The Iron-Steel Institute or whatever it may be, superb reporting.

In the electronics it runs only two years because it was sub-visible, and it was only carried on, you could find out what was better mathematically, and with the mathematics you didn't doubt it at all you'd put in a better way. That was one of those again the way things move in that invisible world. So the, they have in the airplane, you need it very badly because they are very dangerous art, but you don't put it in until you're really sure it works so there is a five year lag. I found there was a ten-year lag in automobiles between a good invention and it's being used by industry. It turned out to be a fifteen year lag in railroading, it turned out to be a twenty-five year lag in relation to big buildings in the city, and about a forty-five year to fifty year lag in single-family dwelling.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"TnKp3UwJx\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"To give you a little idea in the building industry of the very slowness, the part of the development of production steel, was then you had to have a lot of blast furnaces, you had to have all kinds of ceramics, and Portland Cement, the production of Portland Cement became a by-product of producing steel, using some of the by-products. So that we have the Atlas Portland Cement and these things starting, all along side of the steel companies. It was an amazing thing it was fifty years excuse me forty-five years between the steel company making Portland Cement and a piece of steel dropping into the cement, and using reinforced concrete! That is typical of how long you can avoid the obvious in an art. This is the building world. Everybody knew all the building codes were just compression and all of this, and nobody understood how that reinforcing worked until the days the Harvard Stadium is the first big building built with reinforced concrete. It is a very new art. It didn't come into small buildings and dwellings until I brought it in with that stockade system that I talked to you about in 1922 when I was introducing reinforced concrete columns and so forth into small buildings.

That is bronze roofing, because they really, while building it, if they built it right, and this is not going to rust. So there are enormous amounts of bronze, and the well-built building had brass and copper plumbing and so forth, so I got into exactly how much of copper was in buildings. How much copper was in automobiles. At that time 30 pounds per automobile. It was so expensive they kept down every ounce of it they could. And, so I had all the copper in all the different arts, and how much was out on the ships and so forth. I did find that, in taking this lag, I was able then to find out, where copper really is on inventory, and how long it was going to be before it came out. What I did was to consolidate all of those, integrate the total inventory of all copper and different lags that it was going to come out, and found the average would be, the largest tonnage would come out every 22 years 22 l/2 years, so with that key, I then began looking at the amount of scrap that was beginning to show up in the '30's.

There are design engineers, and design engineers then do design the airplane to start off with, and the design engineers do structural analysis and they know just exactly the right what strength that part has to have, all that is beautifully done. When the design engineering was over at the time of W.W.II, then they were going to have to get into production, and they had what was called then Production Engineering, and Production Engineering then began to look over the parts that had been designed by the design engineers and figure out how you were going to make those parts, and they found out time and again that the designer of the part really had no knowledge at all of tools, didn't really know this he only knew that the center of that metal was stronger than the edges, and things like that he followed those kinds of rules. But the production engineer was deeply familiar with all the fundamentals of production, how many kinds of tools are there? And he could see, because the production engineers are always graduated from being design engineers, so they understand how the design is made by the design engineer, alright, but they really realize then the production of it that part could be changed and you could still do exactly what it had been designed to do, but it can be designed a little differently to do the same function, and then it could be easy to manufacture with this kind of tool, that kind of tool.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"n9qLyfUhE\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"And so, Donald Douglas said, \\\"I'm never going to have any design engineers ever again, who are not already production engineers.

The scientists were not looking for new alloys, but they gradually began to learn so much more about the metallurgy itself, really learning your 18 and 8 is a very important kind of number showing up in the stainless steel. 18 and 8 these are proportions of the chromium and the nickel being added to the steel, and these numbers you can't just make it a little chromium, make it 19 and 8 it doesn't work. These numbers have something to do with the kind of geometry I have been showing you. They began to realize this more and more, that there were only certain phases in which things would associate in the right way so that instead of them looking for, just letting it happen accidentally, they began to really learn where the periodicity occur, what kind of numbers would be showing up and began to be able to actually design some alloys. This came in with the space technology and the re-entry problems. They suddenly had to have materials that would do what no materials they knew of could ever do.

So that they began, then, to do something fascinating. They began developing a set of tools where they would make the end product instantly with the tool. They would make just enough of that alloy, and in it's molten state whatever it was it would go into the end shape instantly. Now this was very not being cut out of any kind of way this is quite a transition from the exploitation of the mine you had to have something to exploit so you could get out some shapes that people are going to buy, to really, then, going after doing the right thing for the right reason. Because you get in that space technology, the aerospace technology, and as far as the aircraft engineer goes, that designs that airplane, he's not interested in making money whatsoever.

It is a very extraordinary matter. And, it wasn't just an invasion at all, I mean it was really a way of life there for a long, great, great number of generations. At any rate, the tin got exhausted in England because everybody identified England with tin, the English, then, represented the best kind of an unsinkable flagship for the reconditioning of ships in the great runs, who came really then, one of the ships who went out of England began to discover that there was a lot of tin in the Malay straits. There still is it is one of the great tin sources today. Later on tin is discovered in Bolivia and much later in Tanganyika. Those are the main places of tin today around the world. There are not very many of them. There is none within the United States, neither in Alaska nor in the United States proper. There is some tin in Mexico and the Mexicans make quite a little with tin.

They got to where they could manufacture they could really set up machinery to do that and you could get the spindles going around and you could do all kinds of tricks with developing the cotton thread, and so forth. So, we have, using the water wheel, and you can make a water fall very readily as the miller learned to do, and then they found that with the great big driving wheel, fastened to the water wheel, then they could have a strap, a belt go up into the factory to another enormous wheel a good wide field pulley which the strap then, the friction of it, made it drive it alright. Then these were connected, they brought power into your building, and then they had shafts shaft hangars all running around those factories, and overhead shafts going everywhere with pulleys on them, and they're all going around. And all being driven from the water power. Then they placed the machines on the different floors of the factory, below the shafting and, from the pulley up above that machine they then have strapping coming down to a driving pulley on the machine.

So that tin made possible getting the wheels going of production of man. A very big part. This was going on in, my first job as I got out of Harvard, my first was a cotton mill where I was learning to be a millwright and a machine fitter, they call it, the English called it, and I learned then to get up each type of these machines, and I'm deeply familiar then with the functions of tin.

So tin cans came in, and tin cans made possible preserving the foods, hermetically sealed.

In that game. Then we began to learn all other kinds of tricks, there were plastic coatings you could put on the metal cheaper than the tin. Tin was an expensive metal.

And what happened was that when they designed a new part for the wing form, then the designing engineer got in his pattern man, and the pattern man, and many really, men, craftsmen like sculptors, they could make a clay model very quickly just a really beautiful form, put a caliper on it just right. Then they made a quick plaster cast, and from the plaster cast they then made this kirksite casting where you make a bronze and so forth. And they made only the female form, and then they made the male form by casting it into the female. But then the female being made they then could also change the design and smooth it up because tin you can scrape it really readily, it is easier to scrape than wood, and it held it's shape so beautifully, so you could dress it lovely, and you could get the female all dressed up very fast, and then cast the male in it with a potting compound and you suddenly had, within three or four hours after engineers had finished the design, you could have these dies made, and they might be the size of this table big things. And the big drop hammers were quite wide, staunch, so you could get something big in there so there was the male, and they put in the aluminum and the drop hammer man learned to he was a hammer man before, and he learns how you can move it just a little in there, and it takes a few passings like that and suddenly there is your shape all nice and dressed-out.

Then, in 192 that was '27, in 1929 I was having lunch, this was the year of the Great Crash, with some architectural engineering editors of architectural engineering magazines in New York. They were the leading magazines, and these were their leading editors. And the Crash was there, it had already occurred, and they were all building had stopped pretty much and these editors were very interested that I had a check list of all this all the problems that designers must cope with. It is good to have such a check list. They liked the idea, and so we developed at that time, a little association we called the Structural Study Associates, and they used to come to my place down in Greenwich Village weekly to meet and talk about structural study problems. They were quite taken with my general approach that I had taken in 1927 about the environment etc., so, at the beginning of all of our meetings, people would say, \\\"Do you have any more items that you can add to the list of things that can happen to you, that we have to cope with?\\\" They added a few and then it finally got to where nobody was adding anything anymore, so it was decided I ought to publish it, so I published it in SHELTER MAGAZINE here in Philadelphia, in 1930, and once something is published, again I say this is something strange because there is something mysterious about getting into print, printing machines belong to humanity, you're getting to talk to a lot of people. You could be trespassing, am I doing something wrong by using the capability to speak? And so I'm saying to somebody, personally I find it is very mysterious, if the system you live in, your things really do get into print, at any rate, how it was once it was in print I felt I didn't have the responsibility of having to remember it any more quite the way it was. There were lots of copies out there, and lots of people know about this. So I was very surprised when I happened to look at it a few months later, in my file, and I, the sheets where I had been working on it, the printer's sheets were there, and I suddenly looked at this thing with new eyes. And I said, this thing is-is really quite crazy, because I had mosquitoes along side of tornado. I said, they are really quite incompatible, I think I ought to take this list and sort it out all over again and in the order of relative severity of its effect on the humans. I don't know why I haven't thought about that before, but I haven't. You can understand how I hadn't actually, because the way I came at it was that I needed to have a list.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"cz5O2zY5p\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"So, I then said, I am going to try to get each of these into a category, and sure enough, I found that I began to put each of my items into a file, a file cover, regular leather file cover, so I had them labeled there. One was called, the only item that could go in their were novae, the explosion of the stars it was very large. And, I called this, you know \\\"ionistic\\\" or something like that, and then it came to \\\"epochal\\\" something enormous, and then something, the word \\\"enormous\\\", and then something \\\"pretty big\\\", and then \\\"not so big\\\", and so forth and down to finally \\\"innocuous.\\\"\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"IbxY8jzQK\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"So I started sorting the things in these envelopes, and sure enough there wasn't everyone of them had something to do with man or something to do with severity, so they all had an envelope that they would go into. So within those envelopes I then began to see, \\\"is one of these a little more than another?\\\" So making little strips I was able to sort them, and sure enough they did arrange out, every single one of them was easily, this was just a little more severe than that one. You really can think about whether hearing trouble versus a scratch on your face, and so forth, you can find out.

When it was done, absolutely clearly the most severe was the least frequent. This was absolutely quantum mechanics of Universe. What the Universe does then, you always she has her energy, you don't make energy, there is energy, so anything she wants to do, she can do a few big ones very infrequently, or a whole lot of little ones very frequently. That's the way the Universe is run. That is quantum mechanics. It always adds up to what have you. So I saw then this was pure quantum mechanics, the big ones are the least frequent, and quite clearly mosquitoes are much more frequent than tornadoes. So, boy, I didn't have to have the name tornado or mosquito any more they could have a number on it. I said this is an incredible kind of a capability of a designer to have, because I'm going to because part of my design was also, then, this total responsibility and recognizing the rates of change in design, I always had specific longevity how long did I expect that this was going to be valid. Not something you were trying to sell and get rid of something you were being responsible for, so I 'm going to design this for five years, therefore this is something that only happens only every 300 years, I probably won't have to bother about it. I wouldn't know how to make a house novae-proof. So I don't try. But I see the things that I can do quite well since you and I wouldn't be around anyway if there were a novae, so I saw what I was really responsible for.

They are corrugated steel, horizontally corrugated sheets that are bolted together, and on the top they had a conic roof. And part of the great New Deal coming in and trying to rehabilitate farms as well as mortgages and so forth, was that they began then to credit the farmer with wheat, so grains could be harvested and put the Government would loan they would pay the people for the harvest that was put in the grain bins, so grain bins were where the little farmer could cash in and the government would hold and stabilize the price really look out for him.

We went down to see a little town on the Mississippi that Chris Morley had been following the records of Edgar Allen Poe and so forth, and he found that Edgar Allen Poe had been going down the East Coast of the United States, and he got down to Louisiana, and was going to go up the Mississippi. And he found that Edgar Allen Poe there was a man who owned the first printing press on the Mississippi in a little town that was on the east bank of the Mississippi, not far across from Hannibal, and he had invited Edgar Allen Poe to come out and be his editor, to start a press on the Mississippi there. It was just a little bit below Nauvoo, where the great colony had been of the Mormons and so forth. And so, Edgar Allen Poe was on his way, and he never got out of New Orleans. I'm sorry to say he also drank quite heavily, then. At any rate. I'm not sorry about anything! Everything is great! He had a good time there. (Everybody in the audience really laughed).

And I have spoken about concave and about convex not being the same the radiation impinging on the convex is defused, and the radiation impinging on the concave is concentrated, so the sun is shining on a convex surface, and the convex surface then defuses the sun's radiation into the atmosphere, and this atmosphere is then heated. And the heated atmosphere means the molecules are becoming a little more active, taking up a little more room, there is no confinement of them now, so they take up more room, so they weigh less, and therefore they start a thermal it starts rising, and the, to take the place of the ones that are rising, air has to rush in from below.

As you cut where you cut, you have your prop fastened to your engine, so there is not a clutch, and you don't take the key and shut the engine off. What you do is you push-in the throttle, you simply starve it of gas, and as you do that then, the prop still goes around, the engine is always connected, so the pistons are going up and down like that, and the engine the ship is slowing down, and by the time you make a landing you want to be where you get to a nice stalling speed. So you had to start this slowing down. You then learn that the air being pulled through the carburetor, gets pulled through a fine little hole in the needle valve, by an enormous pull, and you have to put on what you call \\\"carburetor heat\\\" before you force your throttle back you put on \\\"carburetor heat\\\" where they take all the heat possible from the manifold and concentrate it around that carburetor, because otherwise it will freeze up with you, because it gets so cold, so that when you are going to make your landing, now, you have made your glide, and now you're coming in, and suddenly you need you're going to hit some wires, the wires you're not high enough need a little more engine no engine.

I said, way back in '27, one place I've really got to start and really meet the conditions, and where there would be no defense would be in the Arctic, sure enough, the first place my domes really ever went was the Arctic, and in great numbers.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"jAAPfaKeJ\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"It is interesting. I'm just going to give you a finishing figure tonight. The Western Electric Company who are the parts manufacturers for the Bell System and the Telephone Company, I'm sorry to say the Federal Government made, I think, a very great mistake right now. Their anti-trust is trying to break up the Western Electric that manufactures parts for the company who gives this service with the parts. At any rate, Western Electric had the contract to install the Defense Early Warning System, it was a fantastic contract. How many DEW line radomes there are, I guess it is still classified information, but there are a great many of them, ringing the Arctic all the way from Scandinavia across the Iceland and Greenland and so forth across all of Northern Alaska, down Canada and Alaska and down the Aleutians, and, the Western Electric's operation and most of this had to be on snow, and these extraordinary conditions of the ice-frozen ground. Terrible stuff to work with anyway, but practically everything had to go by air. Some things got up by ship, when they got to having their northern passage, but the operation that Western Electric did in installing that under the adverse conditions of the Arctic, in which it is really terrific to operate, the logistics of it are very fascinating.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"vOF2kLznn\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"The actual weight of materials moved, the foot/pounds of work they did was equivalent to what went into building the great wall of China, and the great wall of China I think was 300 years, and this was done in 3 years under those Arctic conditions. It was one of the most incredible operations of history. I don't know of anything quite so formidable as really undertaken in such a big way, and really so superbly executed. To really try to break up then a Western Electric is just my idea of the industries that really count are the service industries, and you have to have the very deep cooperation between the Bell System and the Western Electric. I'd like to go on the witness stand with the Federal Government, but most of the time I'm glad they'd be tackling big money, but I don't think of them as big money. The operation of the telephone company has always been really in a sense very moral, it's been a great deal owned by the people of the actual workers, it's been as reasonably as moral as an enterprise could really be as far as it is an enterprise.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"kBzq54wyy\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"And I think but I think the consideration of the worker and everything has been really phenomenal, I'm really a severe critic of these things, so I did, do like to have built into our piece that I hope they will not break up the very, to me absolutely essential intimacy, and from a DESIGN SCIENCE viewpoint of the Western Electric and the Bell System.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"zf4feHuyl\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"This is in Thule, this is the northern end of Greenland, almost up to the North Pole.
