She takes her own rock apart, and we could learn, then, how you take things apart.

Now, this would be a highly specialized kind of item, but you see North America there, and you see Florida where Cape Kennedy is, about here.

So it's just Australia and South America. South America has four percent of humanity. Australia has not one percent, and Antarctica is not one percent, so only four percent of humanity are south of that line. Which says then that 96% are north of that line. Therefore, the pole, the North pole of that line, would be nearest to the most people.

So, if I go around the equator which is a great circle also, one quarter around the earth, and I take a meridian back to the north pole, I leave the equator at 90 degrees.

A square is an area bound by a closed line of four edges and four angles, all equal, etc. All the geometries that we learned about were areas bound by closed lines. That's the way it was given to us. So all that we accredit about a triangle is what you see on one side of the line it's the little area inside here. Now, the fact is, I said you have to draw a triangle on something, because I'm going to be operational remember. There is no, even if I say an imaginary triangle, I'm going to be imagining one I scratched in the ground. I continually will imagine a special case. I talked with Sonny Applewhite a whole lot about this last night. While human beings are able to discover the mathematics of the generalized case, and though we are able to use the principle, we always have to use it, as I showed you the other day, objectively, in special case. And even though we understand the principle, when we are imagining it and I gave you conceptionality independent of size we will always however, when we make it conceptual, when we make the dots of something, we make the points out of something. We tend to very quickly associate. We'll make it pink or something like that in a blue background if we're abstracting it. But you'll find that the brain has to use special case. Brain is designed for special case. And only mind has it.

And I say \\\"You've drawn four triangles.\\\" And he says \\\"No, I've just drawn one triangle.\\\" And I have to prove to him that he has drawn four triangles. So, we're in Philadelphia here, and so he's drawing on the ground here, a little tiny triangle. I say, \\\"When you drew the triangle on there, you divided the surface of the you did it on the surface of the earth, and you divide the surface of the system that you did it on into two areas. You will agree that if I make a circle around the equator that I divided it into the northern and southern hemisphere, don't you?\\\" \\\"If I make the circle a little further north of the equator, I'll have divided the earth into two areas, a large southern and a small northern. If I get a little further north, it's a smaller northern and larger southern.\\\" So the little boy has drawn a triangle here, but it has divided the whole earth into two areas. And the, both areas are bound by a closed line of three edges and three angles. So I say, \\\"You have drawn a very, very big triangle of all the rest of the earth here, and it's corners are you think you've got 60 it's corners, then are sixty from they are 300 degrees each. So the big triangle is 300 \\\"He says \\\"I'm not used to a triangle of 300 degrees.\\\" and I said \\\"Well, because your school made you so specialized and so absolutely myopic, as not to pay attention to your environment. That's really we've got to really think of the reality, and the point is you have deliberately done something to our earth you have divided it into two areas.\\\" And he said \\\"I didn't mean to be doing it.\\\" And I said \\\"You thought up to now that you were not responsible, and now you are responsible, you're doing that whole earth.\\\" So he said, \\\"Alright, you can give me two triangles a very big one, and a very small one. Where are the other two?\\\" And I said \\\"Concave and convex are not the same.\\\" And he can prove that by the reflection of light the diffusing of light on one side, and the concentrating of light on the other and so there is always there going to be a big concave and a little concave, and a big convex and a little convex.

Just thinking about the well-known kinds the Mercator is a very simple thing. You have a cylinder of paper around a globe. And this cylinder of paper is tangent to the globe at the equator. And you have a globe, let's say it is transparent, and there are the outlines of the continents on it, and there are, on the globe there the latitude and longitude lines, and we have a light at the exact center of the globe, and so the lines whether it is the continent or the great circles, make lines on the paper. They are shadow lines. So we see that the light coming from the center, that where the cylinder is tangent to the globe the things are very accurate absolutely correct.

So the further north you get with a Mercator, the more and more distorted things are. So, all the Mercators are actually \\\"fudged\\\" there at the top.

You have, instead of a cylinder, you have a cone. And the cone could just touch the earth at one point, so where it touched would be accurate, and again, as you go away from it you get inaccurate. But the polyconic, we have a cone of paper that goes into the earth and comes out of the earth again. Can you see? A sphere where there is a cone coming like this and it penetrates here, making a lesser circle, and then it comes out into another circle, can you see that? So, where the two circles occur, they both are accurate, so the intervening space is less distorted, so the polyconic has been by far the least distorted of all the methods of projection in the past.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"afHhAYMCD\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"And this way you have the light at the center, and this is hitting on a piece of paper you have what you call a polyazimuthal.

I used an icosahedron because it has again, then, the largest number of identical triangles. You remember that as you get a smaller and smaller triangle, the sums of the angles get less and less. If I'm going to want to have something out in the flat, then I'd like to get as near to the flat condition as possible, so that there are 20 identical equilateral triangles in the icosahedron, and that is the largest number of absolutely similar forms. You remember we saw yesterday that you can divided that into 120 small right triangles. The amount of the sums of the angles of a spherical triangle add up to over 360 degrees. It's called spherical excess. When the surveyors survey, they use, always watch out for this \\\"spherical excess.\\\" So I would like to have the minimum spherical excess.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"OxjFsdCAg\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"For instance, if I were to use the spherical tetrahedron, it's corner angles would be 120 degrees each, so I would have 120 degrees spherical excess in my triangle. Alright? So, if I use the spherical octahedron, the next system, I would have 90, 90, 90 270 degrees above 180 degrees, so I have 90 degrees spherical excess. And getting down to the spherical icosa, each of the corners is 73 degrees and 26 minutes. So I have the, so when you have the five come together around one, you divide 360 by 5 and you come out 720 is an equilateral triangle, so 720 goes to 60 each corner. 72 at each corner, a spherical triangle icosahedron has 72 degrees at each corner. So that when you flatten it into an equilateral triangle each corner is 60 so that there is only 12 degrees spherical excess at each corner, and a total of 36 degrees for the whole total triangle. In other words, it is the one which has the least spherical excess to start off with. So I said, that is an optimum condition, I'm going to have to have it beautiful, because the excess is divided three ways which is symmetry. So what will happen, is because I have twenty of those triangles then, with three corners each, so there are sixty packages of l2 degrees each around the map that will subside to 60 degrees, and that is really an invisible amount, because the total triangle subsides. It means that everything shrinks symmetrically, so it is just the interior of the triangle shrinks a little faster than the edge the edge, absolutely no change at all. Because where the edge is is true contact, so I have by far the most with the thirty edges of it, 63 degrees and 26 minutes each you're going to get thirty times 63 degrees thirty times sixty all this is absolutely true. As I have by far the most great circling, it is absolutely true to start of with, and I am going to have symmetrical subsidence locally, and the beautiful thing about it would be that where it is contacting this triangle itself that is all true. So all the change is internal rather than external. Now, when you make two circles, one of a circle radius of one and another of circle radius two, you find that you dismiss your error outwardly in the circle radius two, the area of circle radius two is three times the area of circle radius one, so if I dismiss my error outwardly, I have three times as much error as if I dismiss it inwardly.

I'm going to put a rod two rods one through this end of the steel ruler and a rod through the other. These are very powerful strong rods, they don't bend. And I'm going to take then, these rods, exactly perpendicular to the ends of the steel ruler. I going to have them protrude clear through down deeply and I'm going to take hold of the ends of those rods, and bring them together, and you're going to find that it makes the steel bend very beautifully, and the rods come to a common center here. So it makes kind of a circular triangle with arc radius. Now, I'm going to take three such bands, and I'm going to where the corner make a triangle with them, and bring their corners together, and again have a swiveling rivet go through the hole of the corners, and these powerful rods can come through. We have three rods and three corners, and the thing is standing up with a flat triangle like that with these three legs down. I take hold of the bottom of these legs, which are stiff, and bring them together. As I do so we found that any two of them coming together made the single band bend, didn't we, so all three bands have to bend, because there are three rods, each one any pair of them with ends at any one steel band. So as I pull them together, all three steel bands bend. And as they do so the farthest any one side of the triangle with the bend rotates away from the opposite angle, being due to the rods, also, being brought to a common center because they come to the center of gravity. And so we can see that it makes each one of these arcs bend outwardly and makes them able to do a rotating away from each other. We, then, really get at that spherical triangle that I had I simply took those rods, those powerful rods, and brought them to a common universal joint, and we're able then the bands in this case were a delicate, very powerful aluminum high alloy 73 ST Aluminum, so you could go, that really was a sphere showing itself here, and as the rods went northerly and southerly, it kept just embracing the earth with the spherical triangles, opening a little further and closing a little further.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"oahKzqL4c\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"I want you to understand then, how, then you are able to take a band of even module absolute module and make it into the spherical.

So they very arbitrarily, getting into the centimeter as nice as it is, it is o.k. in relation to decimal system, if decimal system is what nature is using, but the arbitrary thing is decimal because we've got five fingers on each hand.

Then they found that the water changed its volume with temperature. They hadn't thought about that and that became very upsetting thing, so they finally had to add that 4 degrees centigrade in the temperature there, then it fills one cubic centimeter. That gave you then, the official gram. So then we have, I spoke about dealing in weight, lifting a given weight against gravity, a given distance. So, lifting one gram one centimeter in one second CGS this is the centimeter gram second, and in relation to x,y,z coordination, this became the built-ins. But even then, they didn't have time in there. So the longevity, it didn't say how old the water was. There was nothing in there to really identify time. So I became interested, and I said \\\"Nature does have her time, because I find that you are just so old, and I'm so old, etc. There was a time dimension.

I said that if I used the vector, the vector is an experience. And does represent an event. And does represent an amount of physical Universe as mass, going in a given direction at a given velocity. Because velocity then has both has time in it. So this is very satisfactory so I got both frequency and time all of these things nicely in there, and those kind of vectorial lines are beautiful because they don't go to infinity. Again, the mathematician kept telling me about infinity and I said, I remember when the teacher said \\\"This line goes on to infinity,\\\" and I said \\\"have you ever been there?\\\" She said \\\"No\\\". I said \\\"how do you know it goes to infinity then?\\\" At any rate, so I said \\\"Well where does the other end go to?\\\" She said \\\"infinity.\\\" I said \\\"which way is infinity, then?\\\" So she couldn't tell me which way infinity was, and I didn't like this infinity very much. I liked something , because I also had never personally experienced infinity, and I'd like to have something that went along with my experience.

Because that then would have then the time quality, and would have the velocity, and the velocity and mass impact converted to heat, so it would have all the elements of experience in it. So if I could only get a geometry of vectors, that would be great. Then came the moment in my learning about science that we were learning about Avogadro. And Avogadro had a very extraordinary intuitive awareness, I spoke to you earlier about the human beings, and the five lights in the sky and becoming interested in it. I also spoke to you about Priestly making his experiment with fire under a bell jar, and how Lavoisier identified he said why the products of the fire added up to more than the weight of the things he put in it. Which was because something else had joined in, and it came out of the \\\"nothingness\\\" which was the air, out of this then we get for the first time that elements were gases. And this was so terribly important as to really open up as I said, thermodynamics and everything. It is not surprising that the next five elements to be discovered were all gases, and it was because we had the enormous competition of who was going to run the ocean world, so the French were putting up money for their scientists, and the kings of France and the king of Spain, and everybody was putting up money for the scientists and so we have Lavoisier is French; and incidentally, one of the most extraordinary things that society ever did that was blind and short-sighted was that in the French Revolution they cut off Lavoisier's head. Of all the heads to cut off! I can't think of a worse choice. At any rate.

Avogadro then said, \\\"it looks as though that all gases under identical pressure and heat would disclose the same number of molecules for given volume.\\\" \\\"Boy, I said, this is something!\\\" He then went onto prove it. Suddenly then we have volume and number for a plurality of gases which are elements. And you know how that elements are elements because they are unique were coming together volumetrically and number-wise, which is very much better than just putting water into a cube. Nice! So I said \\\"It could be because elements go through their liquid, their gaseous and their crystalline states there seemed to be that kind of inter-transformability. And the only reason that certain things are crystalline in our planet is its relative conditions of this part of Universe. There has to be this set of heat. And in the sun they're going to be incandescent, they may be plasmic. I see then, because the elements can go thru liquid, gaseous and we might then think about all the elements under some identical conditions. So instead of just saying under identical conditions of heat or pressure. That's what he has said about the molecules of gas. I said, it could be, you could generalize that, and all elements under identical energy conditions, which means under either heat, or pressure, or any of them, might disclose the same number of somethings per given volume. I don't know what is going to show up. But I thought, that should be more or less the nature of the generalization. So I said, \\\"If then, I want to have a geometry made of vectors, and all the energy conditions are the same, then all the vectors will be the same. That's wonderful! \\\" So I say, it not only means they are all going to be the same length, but they are going to be converging at the same kind of angles. I said, can you make a model where all the vectors are the same length, and they are all converging and also, but they have to take care of the actions and reactions and resultants so they must be angles joining angles at both ends of the lines. Can I get a system where all the vectors are in a closed system? All the same length? and all the angles are the same?

There was a sort of as I grew up there was a sort of feeling, you were being told by grown ups, you know you may lose your hearing, but you've still got your sight.

And I felt a great necessity to make an experiential, operational assessment of our senses. Having been, then, myself not having had the seeing, at the outset and having had primarily the hearing, the smelling and the touching. Because, as I was young, I can't tell you how much I smelled. The smelling was very, very important. I really was almost like a dog, and I knew people by their smells. To such an extent, my father said that, just in the last few years my sensitivity of smelling is going down like my hearing. It seems to be nervous, the nerves are breaking down, but through my life smelling had been so I always really smelled people. That was the first thing about them. And if they smelled wrong to me, they were not going to be my kind of a pal that's all. There was no question about their smelling.

Even though you can't see foggy night, you still feel very very comfortable with your feet.

Well at earth's level, we have 400 MPH in some of the stratosphere, but the level at which you and I operate, the best winds we have, the fastest is down in the Antarctic, 180 mph.

And what you're looking at I've made, I've put little transparent Plexiglass red triangles and white triangles. And I've mounted them on the rods. Could you go back to the picture itself now? You are going to see that there are eight octahedra showing there. But if you look very carefully, you're going to see some white or clear sheets. Those are the vector equilibria. There are vector equilibria and the octahedra those are the external octahedra. Now, each of those triangles has a, we put a stove pipe rivet through it a journal made of brass. We are able to mount those triangles on the rods. The triangle's corners are tied together with just a little Dacron thread so that they are vector equilibria. So the vector equilibrium is open, and the red ones are vector equilibria that are closed into the octahedronal state like this. We found on that frame, we put carbon dust so that everything would slide it's very best, I took one pencil and pushed one face of the white, clear vector equilibrium that is open, just push on one face, just one force operating the whole system, and the vector equilibria collapse, all the vector equilibria collapse, and all the red octahedra open up. But it is a very three-way kind of affair I assure you, because due to the internal and external octahedra. But what happens when I push on there every sphere becomes a space and every space becomes a sphere. Now when you come to this kind of an aggregate, for instance in a liquid, you begin to see how you can pierce thru a liquid. Because the spheres keep getting out and keep becoming a space. This to me is a very extraordinary matter, because now this is made symmetrically. There are the eight octahedra that you see showing and there are the I think there are the same number, yes, there are the same number of vector equilibria, and they simply interchange.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"R2y4UOyDR\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"What you're in this model because they are all mounted on those wires, as remember this thing rotates as it opens therefore the corners of the triangles take a little more space. And there are a number of other models I am going to be showing you tomorrow and Monday in which you'll see then tetrahedra rotating in cubes. It's a fascinating thing but they do. Float absolutely beautifully through cubes. But anyway, you'll find that the way the tetrahedra rotate in cubes, make the cube's sides bulge out every way like that. So when I make one sphere become a space in a system, and have the space become a sphere, the whole all the wires bulge outwardly symmetrically. Pulse outwardly like this. They are changing from sphere to space it makes it do this. You see for the first time, remember when we dropped the stone in the water you see a wave. This is the first time you see electromagnetic waving propagated. Actually, the model does it.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"fSbfUhtIB\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Can I have the next picture please, and you'll see it happen. Now all the red octahedra opened in the vector equilibrium form, and all the little white octahedra nested. I have this model in our Cambridge office. It is quite old, it's l951-71, it's 23 years old and it's getting a little poor, but to me this was sort of the supreme moment of Synergetics.

It is now almost half past three twenty after three. I would like to keep myself fresh. Can you tell me how much time we have done today? (From the audience \\\"We've got about 4 1/2 hours') We got something then worthwhile do you feel? I would think that I might go a little slow on you now, and I'd like not to do that. So let us break up. I would like you to realize we have enough tape for sixty hours. I don't think we're going to make the sixty hours. If we did four hours today, and I think we had let's see, we're about at twenty, and we have just about the same amount of run ahead. I think we may get up to forty, and it is my suspicion that I have learned to say things more compactly. I know that I am really covering a whole lot of territory today, where I used to go quite detailed following, I'm exploring myself and now I'm so much more familiar that probably I am compacting the sixty hours into the forty. I feel that way about it. So that I think we're going to have the total experience. If we get to the end of the time, I'm quite certain that I'm not going to be withholding from you some of the things that I feel are all this important interrelatedness, because I do come into you time and again with new kinds of thrusts, and yet you find everything getting back into the same fundamental world.
