Right\\u2026\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"Pp9t_3C3R\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - We would often use fancy language and call it a vibration, or an oscillation.

A wiggle up and down, or side to side, or backwards or forwards.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"Z3SBDHshm\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - Yes, and the energy that was in this initial wiggle is then carried by a medium, like air or water from where the wiggle started in all directions possible.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"3m_3OJxOm\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - So, when I drop a stone on a lake, I cause the surface at the point of impact to wiggle up and down and side to side. This energy then spreads out in all directions.

So, if the energy spreads out in all directions, it must create a weaker and weaker effect. So, once a ripple has spread out 100 metres into all directions, the energy in the ripple is perhaps barely noticeable to the human observer. Instead of causing perhaps several trillion molecules to each move a few centimetres up and down, the energy might now be causing many trillions of water molecules to each move up and down by a few micrometers.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"CuVCB46bi\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - So, any time you hear someone speak, it\\u2019s worth realising that the energy in the sound wave is not just coming towards you, it\\u2019s spreading out in all directions, however it can. This explains why you can\\u2019t hear people over large distances. It\\u2019s not because they\\u2019re too far away from you at all. It\\u2019s because the energy is going in all directions and only a tiny percentage of it is going to be directed towards you.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"OkeBaWKuF\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - So, on with some more stuff on waves.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"Q1ixz7PTl\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - There\\u2019s basically two main types of waves: Waves that move in all directions and just keep going, and waves that somehow get trapped.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"_3ZX3UIG5\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - The ones that continue to go on for ever are called progressive waves, because they make progress!

Other examples of standing waves are in musical instruments, when you play the guitar, the saxophone, the violin and the organ. Music is only possible because of this ability to trap standing waves in tubes or on strings.

So, a ripple in a lake is a transverse wave. The surface of the water is moving up and down and the wave is moving from one side of the lake to the other.
