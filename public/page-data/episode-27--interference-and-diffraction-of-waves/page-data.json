So, let\\u2019s say we now drop two stones into the lake fairly close to each other. Each stone creates an impact in the water which pushes the water molecules near the point of impact either up a bit or down a bit. This energy of impact is effectively the instructions which tell neighbouring water molecules to move up or down and so on. This \\u2018up and down\\u2019 -ness is seen as a bump in the water surface which spreads out as an ever increasing circle in all directions. We usually call it a \\u2018ripple\\u2019.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"4spJ2qmZX\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - And each ripple is what we see - the set of instructions from each event.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"oh6OGSiSK\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - So, the key thing to think about is 'when are two different sets of instructions likely to cause constructive and destructive interference.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"6dl9FO6Kd\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - It turns out with 2 different events, the instructions are difficult to compare easily. Which is why we use an experiment called Young's Double-slit experiment to get a handle on what's going on.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"UYMIMl3ue\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - What exactly is the double-slit experiment?\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"3e-LpSXFS\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Well the idea was this: how could we easily compare the instructions from different events, when the events are not coordinated in any way?\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"PjDATOi8p\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - Well we can't. that's the point.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"3GUI6Nztz\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Precisely. Young's genius was to design a way of having 2 interfering events that were really following the same set of instructions. So, he set up a single light source (he actually used the sun) and he passed this sunlight through 2 very narrow vertical gaps (slits) that were separated by a very small distance.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"fo9CIH6JN\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - OK, and what did he find out?\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"np3YHMGj1\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Well, from diffraction, we know that each slit now acts as a new source of waves. And since these new sources of waves have both come from the same original source, they are totally 'in sync' with each other. This synchronisation of waves has a special physics word which is 'coherence.' The two sources are said to be coherent.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"FaCKB2_Cn\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - This just means that we can easily spot if they are adding up together constructively or destructively when they are superimposed. Waves ALWAYS interfere both constructively and destructively but it's only when they are coherent that we can observe the interference.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"mpekLj_Uy\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - So, anyway, it turns out that Young could see a nice interference pattern, much like water waves in a harbour. This was further proof that light had wave tendencies. Newton's point of view - that light was corpuscular (made of particles) was the prevailing view at the time. Because Newton was so influential and it was Young's double slit experiment that showed unequivocally that light was a wave. At least for a while, until Einstein came along with the photo-electric effect and showed that actually light could behave like a particle as well.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"9ajku-cg4\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - By the way it's worth noting something important here: Light is not both a wave and a particle and it is not neither wave nor particle. Light behaves sometimes like a wave and sometimes like a particle, depending on the experimental setup.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"WXTYrRkWG\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Yes. Strange but true. We don't really know what light IS. But we do know how it behaves in certain situations. And more importantly, we can predict how it will behave in these situations, which makes it science after all.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"wKdQLwXsD\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - It's pretty difficult to explain the geometry behind all this without some diagrams, but we can quote the formula that Young discovered, relating the interference patterns that he observed.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"EL1LPMPZ1\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Yes, it turns out that there was constructive interference when the waves were perfectly in phase.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"onT3fC25C\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - What does in phase mean exactly?\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"NDozYQ12j\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - In phase means that the peak of one wave is exactly on top of the peak of the other.

Yes, and a 3 m difference and so on.\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"ziAxkoPX6\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"T - I get it. So, whenever the path difference was equal to a whole number of wavelengths?\", mdx(\"span\", {\n    id: \"ZaLthiSfd\"\n  })), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"H - Precisely.
