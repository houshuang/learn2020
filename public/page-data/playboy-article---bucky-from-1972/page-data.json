That\\u2019s how surprised they were. Then, in 1927, I was wheeling my little daughter Allegra in her baby carriage in Chicago and a little airplane went overhead. And my little baby was lying there looking up at the airplane in the sky. It was still a very rare matter. That was the year Lindbergh flew the Atlantic. Then two years later, the first night airmail went out of Chicago in a cloth-covered biplane, and not until four years later did we have our first aluminum airplane.

Now when you get on a jet, you look around and there are a couple hundred people being lifted into the air and only a few even bother to look out the window. The rest are reading or sleeping. Why?
